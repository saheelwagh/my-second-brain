# How to take smart notes
- Book for students, academics and nonfiction writers
- must read for anyone who reads a lot - [[Ali Abdaal]]
- Some books are about style and structure. Others are about how to get the motivation to sit down and how to move through writer’s block. This book is the gap between the two.
- This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way.


1. Take [[literature notes]] while reading
	1. highlight stuff and note down what resonates with you
2. at review, create [[permanent notes]] from [[literature notes]]
	1. one note per idea
	2. as if teaching
	3. include references
	4. relevant to your areas of focus
3. link to your [[zettelkasten]]


[[writing is the medium of all work]]
“Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.

aim -> to not have to use willpower when writing

## 10 main principles
1. Writing is not the outcome of thinking, but its medium
2. work as if writing is the only thing that matters
	1. You’ll try to learn the basics as efficiently as possible so you can get to the point where open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about.
	2. Almost every aspect of your life will change when you live as if you are working toward publication.
		1. You’ll read differently, becoming more focused on the parts most relevant to the argument you’re building
		2. You'll ask sharper questions
		3. You’ll naturally seek venues to present your work, since the feedback you receive will propel your thinking forward like nothing else.
3. Nobody starts from scratch
	1. You’ll know you’ve succeeded in making this shift when the problem of not having enough to write about is replaced by the problem of having far too much to write about. When you finally arrive at the decision of what to write about, you’ll already have made that decision again and again at every single step along the way.
	2. Taking notes allows you to break free from the traditional, linear path of writing. It allows you to systematically extract information from linear sources, mix and shake them up together until new patterns emerge, and then turn them back into linear texts for others to consume.
4. tools and tech = useful only as the workflow
	1. Good systems don’t add options and features; they strip away complexity and distractions from the main work, which is thinking.
	2. An undistracted brain and a reliable collection of notes is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter.
5. Standardization enables creativity
	1. shipping containers analogy
	2. Notes are like shipping containers for ideas. Instead of inventing a new way to take notes for every source you read, use a completely standardized and predictable format every time. It doesn’t matter what the notes contain, which topic they relate to, or what medium they arrived through – you treat each and every note exactly the same way
6. Our work only improves with hq feedback
	1. [[digital writer]]
	2. Feedback also helps us adjust our expectations and predictions about how much we can get done in an hour or a day. Instead of sitting down to the amorphous task of “writing,” we dedicate each working session to concrete tasks that can be finished in a reasonable timeframe: Write three notes, review two paragraphs, check five sources for an essay, etc. At the end of the day, we know exactly how much we accomplished
7. Work on multiple simultaneous projects
	1. [[locus of control]]
8. Organize by context, not topic
	1. context to be used in
9. Always follow the most interesting path
	1. This advice runs counter to the typical approach to planning we are taught. We are told to “make a plan” upfront and in detail. Success is then measured by how closely we stick to this plan. Our changing interests and motivations are to be ignored or suppressed if they interfere with the plan.
10. Save contradictory ideas
	1. The real enemy of independent thinking is not any external authority, but our own inertia. We need to find ways to counteract[[confirmation bias]]

The core idea of Smart Notes is that purely extracting highlights is generally a waste of time. A highlight speaks to you when you take it, but if you don't capture the idea that the highlight gave you, you're unlikely to remember the importance of that highlight later. Or even if you do feel some spark when revisiting the highlight, it might be a different interpretation.

According to interviews with Luhmann, work was "effortless" for him because of the system he'd developed for taking, and utilizing notes on everything he'd read and thought. Many writers and researchers have attempted to describe how other people can replicate this system themselves, but according to Sonke, they miss the mark.

The important question here is: **how can I make this idea detailed enough to stand on its own, without the context of the book or the associated highlight?** You want each of these ideas to be fully formed thoughts that you can reference in a bunch of different areas later.

storing -> **In which context do I want to stumble on it again ?**



[[physcial notes]]


Ahrens recommends the following 8 steps for taking notes:

1.  Make fleeting notes
2.  Make literature notes
3.  Make permanent notes
4.  Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box
5.  Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box
6.  Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box
7.  Turn your notes into a rough draft
8.  Edit and proofread your manuscript


He notes that Luhmann actually had _two_ slip-boxes: the first was the “bibliographical” slip-box, which contained brief notes on the content of the literature he read along with a citation of the source; the second “main” slip-box contained the ideas and theories he developed based on those sources.

### **5. Develop your topics, questions, and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box**

With so many standardized notes organized in a consistent format, you are now free to develop ideas in a “bottom up” way. See what is there, what is missing, and which questions arise. Look for gaps that you can fill through further reading.

If and when needed, another special kind of note you can create is an “overview” note. These notes provide a “bird’s eye view” of a topic that has already been developed to such an extent that a big picture view is needed. Overview notes help to structure your thoughts and can be seen as an in-between step in the development of a manuscript.
