# Restart Blogging 2021
## [[Niche]] : Topic X Writong style X Target audience

### examples of niche :
-   **Productivity** (topic), written about **humorously** (style/format), for **middle-aged men** (audience).
-   **Make money online** (topic), written about in **Twitter threads** (style/format), for **college students** (audience).
-   **Gardening** (topic), written about as **markup** (style/format), for **software developers**(style/format).

### Problems associated with niches:
1. You may turn predictable -> every article can be guessstimated
2. How do you know you are the right person to listen to in a niche ?

#### Bombing in a niche ?
Ever told a joke at a party that bombed ?
I have never. As an introvert that is one event that I strive to prevent. 
But I have used the following pickup line :
{}
No, i did not use it. I stole it. 

What happens if you settle in on a niche ?
1. You tackle it in your style.
2. Your freinds support you.
3. The comparison starts with others.
4. You realise you suck. 


### So what to find before your niche ?
#### FInd your niche
