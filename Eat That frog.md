[[Productivity]]

[[Brian Tracey]]
# Intro
This book contains a collection of ideas that have helped the author succeed in life.
[[Brian Tracey]] has studies time management for more than 40 years. Immersing himself in the works of :
- [[Peter Drucker]]
- [[Alec Mackenzie]]
- [[Alan Lakein]]
- [[Stephen Covey]]

Every idea he encountered, he tried it out. If it worked, he incorporated in his talks and 
seminars. He teaches 21 of them here. 

[[Galileo]] -> You cannot tech a man anything you can onoly help him find it within hi8mself. 
The author hopes 21 techniques help you form prouctive habits within you.

We all can relate to this feeling : 
There is never enough time to do everything you have to do. You're swamped with work and personal commitments. Your schedule is punctured with emails, social media, meetings.

Books and magazines, courses pile up as you never get enough time to completete them.
[[My Udemy Courses]]
Also many lesiure activities or new experiences that you want to try out. You promise yourself to visit these when you want to get caught up. 

But fact is tht you will never get caught up. I've been trying to catch up for a year.
You will never get on tip of taks. No matter how many personal productivity techniques you master, there will always be more to do than you can ever accomplish in the time you have available to you, no matter how much it is.




## so how to change status quo ?
You take control of your time and your life when you change the way you
- think
- work, and
- deal with responsibilities.

The secrets reduced to one line is :
1. Stop doing some activities and use the freed up time to double down on a few key activities. [[80-20 Principle]] .
2. [[Learn from successful people]]

As a young man Brian took up a sales job. With sales stagnating, he asked succesful peers what they were doing differently. Applied their advice and slaes went up.
Thus he formed a system of learning and applying what experts do. 

[[Outlook of unuscessful people to success]]
- We assume people succeed because they are better than us. When in reality they just do things differently.
- Thus they belive it is not something which can be learnt. 

# The simple truth of success
One thing I already like about this book is that the preface itself has the summary of the book. In Brian;s words : 
The Ability to concentrate single-mindedly on your most important task is the key to success.
In today's information age, there a lot of good things you can do. The biigest determinant of your sucess is your ability to decide among them. And fast.
