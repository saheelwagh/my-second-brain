In the modern world we are focussed on controlling our surroundings as much as possible
[[Locus of control]]
it’s only when we
take off the training wheels and move away from the safe and the familiar that we find the unexpected
[[answers as a source of discovery]]
- no longer a scrace commodity
- knowledge has never been cheaper
- answers are the beginning, not the end


UNKNOWN KNOWNS
When we assume we have a lock on the truth, certainty blinds us to our own paralysis. The illusion of knowledge,
rather than ignorance, is the obstacle to discovery. When we admit we don’t know, our egos deflate and our minds
open. It’s better to be uncomfortably uncertain than comfortably wrong.

- contain uncertainty
- write down what you know and don't know. 	Then you'll realise that fear of unkonwn is much greater than the unknown itself
