- Capture ideas without judging them
- Most ideas come while working / writing
- Then pick the ideas worht writing. This decision depends on your goals. There isn't enough time to write about everything.

- There are a few other things I do to ease into the writing process. **I pick an idea before going to bed. The following day, I sit down at my desk and start writing ten headlines. Then, I choose my favorite one and write from 7 AM to 10 AM in 3x50-minute intervals.  In the first two 50-minute sessions, I research and write the first draft. For research, [I work with my Roamkasten](https://betterhumans.pub/the-complete-guide-for-building-a-zettelkasten-with-roamresearch-8b9b76598df0). In the third 50-minute interval, I edit and hit publish.  **
