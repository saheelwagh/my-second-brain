# Taking Responsibility
[[Rob Dial]] [[Mindset Mentor Notes]]
- not show up most powerfully w/o taking full responsibility
- not resp about outside of control but claiming how you show up to them


# Applied suffering
- why suffering is imp
- pain is inevitable, suffering is optional
- lobster shell -> grow from inside -> applied sffering to break the old shell
- neurotoxicity
- do something uncomfortable every day

# The[[ PARA ]]Method
[[Tiago Forte]]

Imagine for a moment the perfect organizational system. One that supported and enhanced the work you do, telling you exactly where to put a piece of information, and exactly where to find it when you needed it.

-   **universal**, encompassing any conceivable kind of information from any source
-   **flexible**, able to work with any project or activity you take on, now and in the future
-   **simple**, not requiring any time-consuming maintenance, cataloguing, tagging, or reorganizing beyond a bare minimum
-   **actionable**, integrating seamlessly with task management and project management methods
-   **cross-platform**, able to be used with any application, now existing or yet to be developed
-   **outcome-oriented**, structuring information in a way that supports the delivery of valuable work
-   **modular**, allowing different levels of detail to be hidden or revealed, depending on the needs of the current task
-   **opportunistic**, in the good sense, taking advantage of work already being performed, instead of requiring dedicated overhead time

![[Pasted image 20210703151436.png]]

For example, you might find yourself writing the first draft of a blog post, which is linked to the project “product X launch,” which falls under an area of responsibility called “Product Development.” This might be just one of several spheres of activity you are responsible for in your job, along with “Business Strategy,” “Hiring/Staffing,” and “Financial Reporting.” In your personal life, you have still more areas, such as “Parenting,” “Hobbies,” and “Apartment.”

## Projects vs areas
- After much trial and error, and seeing many people struggle to differentiate between them, I’ve come to believe that even the smallest confusion between these two categories is a deeply rooted cause of many personal productivity problems.

![[Pasted image 20210703151619.png]]

A project has a **goal** to be achieved — a discrete event that will happen, allowing this item to be completely checked off and struck from the list. And this goal is supposed to take place by a **specific moment in time**. It has a deadline or timeframe, whether externally or self-imposed.

An area of responsibility, by contrast, has a **standard** to be maintained. And there is no end date or final outcome. Your performance in this area may wax and wane over time, but the standard **continues indefinitely** and requires a certain level of attention at all times.

Projects always fall into Areas. A few examples:

-   Running a marathon is a project, whereas Health is an area
-   Publishing a book is a project, whereas Writing is an area
-   Saving 3 months’ worth of expenses is a project, whereas Finances is an area
-   A vacation to Thailand is a project, whereas Travel is an area
-   Planning an anniversary dinner is a project, whereas Spouse is an area


When working with a client as a productivity coach, one of the first things I will ask them is to show me their Project List. I need this to get a sense of what kind of work they do, their current workload, and what outcomes they are actively working toward.

They usually hand me something that looks like this:

![[Pasted image 20210703151731.png]]

Do you see the problem? Not a single item on this list is a project. Do “vacations” ever end? Is there ever a time when you can cross off “productivity” from your list once and for all? No — these are ongoing areas of responsibility, not projects.

## 3 Crticial fault points if you don't separate the two
1. You can't know the extent of your commitments
	1. You cannot know what to change until you know what you’re committed to. And what you’re committed to is not a collection of vague responsibilities, but a short list of tangible outcomes. In other words, projects.
2. Can't connect current efforts to your long term goals
	1. I often say that with knowledge workers, the biggest bottleneck is always getting up in the morning.
		1. Knowledge work requires not only our time and effort, but also our engagement and creativity. For that reason, personal motivation is the prime problem that supersedes all other problems.
	2. Areas of Responsibility rarely if ever change, remember? No matter how hard you work, how many years of service you put in, the list of never-changing obligations only gets heavier and longer.
	3. I couldn’t design a better method of killing personal motivation if I tried.
	4. By breaking these responsibilities into bite-sized projects (as in the list on the right), you ensure that your Project List will change nearly every week. This creates a rhythm and a momentum of project completion to maintain your motivation. It generates the constant novelty that the latest [research](https://www.amazon.com/Satisfaction-Science-Finding-True-Fulfillment/dp/080507600X) suggests is essential for satisfaction.
3. Can't track or know progress

One final note on projects vs. areas: they require completely different ways of thinking, approaches, tools, and methods. Projects require you to be laser-focused, to ruthlessly drive toward an outcome, to smash through or circumvent obstacles, to ignore distractions (i.e. people). Areas, on the other hand, require mindfulness, balance, flow, and human connection. This is the realm of habits, routines, rituals, and intentional communities. Areas require introspection and self-awareness, because determining whether or not you are meeting your standard is an intuitive exercise, not an analytical one.

You can easily see how failing to make this distinction leads to common frustrations: if you have a project that you think is an area (for example, the book I’ve been “writing” for a couple years now, that feels like a never-ending part of my life), it will tend to continue indefinitely. If you have an area that you think is a project (for example, a health outcome like “losing X pounds”), you’ll revert right back after it’s been achieved, because you didn’t put in place any mechanism for maintaining the standard.

There is a very illuminating exercise you can perform once you’ve taken the time to formulate a clear Project List. Put it side by side with your Goal List, and draw lines matching each project with its corresponding goal:

![[Pasted image 20210703152815.png]]

What most people find is that they don’t completely match. This is problematic because a project without a corresponding goal is known as a “hobby.” If you’re not committed to or haven’t fully articulated the outcome you want, you must be doing it just for fun.

And if you have a goal without a corresponding project, that’s called a “dream.” You may desire it with all your heart and soul, but without an active project, you are not in fact currently making any progress.

#### START BY DEFINING YOUR PROJECT LIST

The bottom line here is, **define your projects, or they will define you**. You’ll be constantly pulled and pushed into the projects of others, and find that even when others offer to help you with yours, you won’t even know what they are.

What this means concretely is that you should define your projects apart from any particular program or tool. Write them down on a piece of paper or in a blank document, away from the hints, incentives, constraints, and assumptions of any software program.

Here’s why this is important: you will always need to use multiple programs to complete projects. You may use a centralized platform like Basecamp, Asana, Jira, or Zoho, but technology is advancing too quickly on too many fronts for any one company to do every single function best.

Instead of fighting the tide and looking for “one platform to rule them all,” formulate your Project List and then replicate that list across every single tool you use, now and in the future. I recommend doing so down to the exact same spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, so that your transitions between programs are as seamless as possible.

The PARA advantage :
![[Pasted image 20210703153249.png]]

**four levels deep** (using Evernote as an example, the levels would be: application > stacks > notebooks > notes).

The number four has been called “magic” due to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515286) indicating it seems to be the natural limit of all sorts of cognitive processes, from working memory to object-tracking to rapid enumeration. In more speculative findings, some primitive tribes seem to have specific words only up to the number four, and many animals seem to be able to distinguish up to four individual objects.

The second principle is that P.A.R.A. **perfectly mirrors your task management and project management systems**. The relatively young field of [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM) has a lot to say on the topic, but I believe that any PKM approach that doesn’t tie into execution tools is destined to languish on the back burner forever

The third principle is that P.A.R.A. preserves and actually enhances the most important distinction that any productivity system must make: **between actionable and non-actionable information**. Making this distinction allows you to set aside 95% of the information coming your way, to focus on the 5% necessary for the task at hand

Day to day, in the trenches of getting things done, you might focus on the first column, looking at material related only to the active projects. This would probably include your task manager (or at least the “Today” or “Next” section of your task manager) as well as the “Projects” stack in a note-taking program like Evernote:

On a wider horizon, for example, while doing a weekly review, you would expand the scope of information you’re considering to include Areas of Responsibility. This is a deeper level of introspection: are you currently meeting the standard you’ve set for yourself in each of the areas you’re committed to? If not, are there any new projects, habits, routines, rituals, or other practices you’d like to start, stop, or change?


On an even wider horizon, perhaps during a monthly review, you could expand the scope of what you’re looking at to include Resources. Are there any new interests you’d like to pursue more seriously? Are there any you’ve allowed to stagnate, that you’d like to reboot? Do any of your current projects give you an excuse to also pursue a related interest?

The Resources stack is also where “research” lives. The notebooks here tend to have the most objectively valuable information, which you may want to access when looking for material to use in a blog post, to recommend to someone, or for a work project. My own collection, below, gives a pretty good indication of my interests, with the number of notes to the right of each notebook title showing how many notes I’ve collected on the topic:

And finally, the Archives are your portfolio of completed projects, each one inactive but ready to offer up potentially useful material to reuse and recycle in future projects. I often find that being able to reuse my notes on a topic, a well-designed slide, a section of a proposal, or other assets saves me tremendous amounts of time, which is especially critical in a freelancing business in which I am doing everything myself. It is also easiest to recall where an asset is located based on when it was created and which project it was associated with, if search doesn’t do the job:

Besides reusing project materials, the Archives can also be used for project retrospectives, annual retrospectives, and resumes and proposals where you need to “show your work.”

## Part 2 : Para Operations Manual 
This post is an **Operations Manual for P.A.R.A.**, diving much deeper into the “inner workings” I’ve seen across many different implementations. Even if you choose not to adopt this system wholesale, there should be lots of tidbits you can apply to your own.

The 3 main sections are:

1.  Definitions and distinctions
2.  Flows and upkeep
3.  FAQs

Third, in order to achieve the goal of rapid project turnover, it is important that **projects be stored all in one place**. Just like if you want tasks to be completed quickly, you should keep them on a centralized task manager or to do list. Imagine the tediousness of having to drill down into 22 separate area notebooks in order to review all my projects, and multiply that effort by the 5–6 platforms I use.

What I’ve noticed is that, somewhat oddly, it’s not that important to associate projects very directly with areas. Because your projects are what you engage with on a daily basis, it’s unlikely you’ll forget what areas/categories they fall into. Whereas it is easy to lose sight of a project’s goal in the midst of daily activity. Thus it’s much more important, in my opinion, to associate projects with their respective goals, rather than areas.

Areas of Responsibility are the **roles you take on in life** and the **hats you wear** (Spouse, Mother/Father, Team Leader, Soccer Coach), the **ongoing standards where the buck stops with you** (Product Development, Company Newsletter, Legal), and **things that take a certain amount of constant attention** (Exercise, Finances, Apartment, Pets).

Resources are **interests** (web design, crowdfunding, woodworking, frisbee golf, bio-hacking), **themes** (psychology, politics, leadership, integrity), and **assets** (stock photos, typography links, marketing swipe file, product testimonials, code snippets). I even use lower-case titles with resource notebooks, to remind myself that they are just interests, and capital letters for areas of responsibility.

### 2. FLOWS AND UPKEEP

One of the key differences between P.A.R.A. and other organizational schemes is that it is a dynamic system, not a static one. It derives its strength not from deeply hierarchical stocks of “knowledge,” which require following strict rules and conventions, but from constantly evolving flows of information between the four categories. The rapid turnover of projects becomes not a risk to be managed, but the actual mechanism by which we maintain the system.
![[Pasted image 20210704162614.png]] (info flow in PARA)

### JUST-IN-TIME ORGANIZATION

You may be wondering, “WHEN exactly am I supposed to be performing all this work ‘flowing’ information from one notebook to another?” The subtext being: “WHO in the world has time for such fastidious, detailed record-keeping?!”

I would suggest performing organizational work _opportunistically_, as opportunities arise, instead of _pedantically_, or “just because.” I call this approach Just-In-Time Organization. What this looks like is making changes to your organizational structure in small batches, as you go along and happen to notice incremental improvements, not in big batches as part of a dedicated effort.

Why? Because “organizing things” is one of those nice-to-have things that people never get around to. And for good reason: it represents time-consuming overhead work with no clear return or impact.

# Interstitial Journaling
- created by Tony Stubblebine
- it’s the simplest way to combine note-taking, tasks, and time tracking in one unique workflow.
- basic idea of interstitial journaling is to write a few lines every time you take a break, and to track the exact time you are taking these notes.
- example
	- **10:04** - Going to finish the first draft of the mindful productivity article.
	- 	**10:46** - I fell into a Twitter blackhole again! Back to work.
	- **11:45** - Made good progress. Need to get ready for meeting with Charlie.
	- **11:49** - Reviewed agenda and docs. Feeling a bit anxious, but I think it will go fine. Need to call Anna after the meeting to debrief.
- Notice the mix of goals (“finish the first draft”), self-awareness (“fell into a Twitter blackhole”, “feeling anxious”), self-review (“good progress”), and actionable items (“call Anna”)?
- I love interstitial journaling because it’s a great way to make your breaks more mindful.
	- -   **Proactive breaks:** reflect on your previous task, plan for the next one, take your own mental pulse, jot down anything else that comes to mind so as to reduce your cognitive load.
	- -   **Procrastination breaks:** become aware of these breaks and how long they actually take. When you create the habit of writing down all your breaks, it becomes easier to not open a new tab to “quickly” check Twitter. You don’t want to have to admit that failure to yourself.
- This is what a daily note with interstitial journaling looks like.

-   **Track time.** Type _/time_ to insert the current time, then type whatever you are thinking about.
-   **Track tasks.** Type _/todo_ to create to-do items. Check off these to-do items when done.
-   **Track content.** When you stumble upon something interesting that would disturb your workflow, add it to master lists such as [[To read]]. You can see I have done it in this screenshot with an interesting-looking article that had nothing to do with the essay I was trying to write.
-   **Track ideas.** Similarly, if you think of something else you’d like to do today, just add it as a to-do where and when you think about it. For people using the [[Today]], [[Tomorrow]], [[Someday]] system, you can also add that to the to-do items, or add a specific date, as I have done with “call Morgane.”
-   **Track well-being.** I like to start my work day with a quick note checking in on how I feel, anything that’s been sometimes literally keeping me up at night, any major roadblock I’m anticipating for the day. It’s rarely longer than one bullet point, but it’s a great way to take care of my general well-being. I also finish the work day with a similar quick closing note.


# Finish What you start
## The Art of following through, taking action,self   discipline
[[Peter Hollins]]
### Intro
- building canoe
	- first week considerable progress on wood block
	- second week : hands sore, new star wars 
	- third week. too busy watching star wars and procrastinating
	- But every time I walked through my garage to my car, the canoe was a
damning reminder of my laziness and inability to follow through. It wore on
me until I committed myself to finishing it a couple of summers later. 
	- same cycle
	- temp bundled with fav audio
- What exactly is finishing what you start and following through? You have  
may heard these phrases before, but what do they mean?  
To me, they mean making your intentions reality.
- Too often, we’ll say we’ll
do something, and we might even start it one lucky weekend. But at the first
sign of hardship, fatigue, boredom, or busyness, we abandon it all too easily
and it sits in our garage (mental, figurative, or literal) for the rest of eternity.
- Finishing what you start and following through is breaking through that
common loop and taking hold of your life

### ch1 : Stop thinking , just execute
- char : Esther
	- stuck in job fant abt quit
	- but how when bills to pay ?
	- dream : baking business
- felt diff one day
	-  mentally more determined
- not quit yet
- 2 week vac leave

1. Planned research but it stayed there in head
2. thought of start and run from scratch overwhelmed her
3.  busied in all other work
4.  thought ppl will think she is too ambitious for her level
5.  thus returned to work with same thought

#### what is following through ?
Think like voltron from power rangers
- focus
	- head
	- concentrrated efforts towards a single goal
	- 
- self disc
	- spine
	- power to regulate thoughts and actions
	- continuous with focus (head spine analogy)
	- 
- action
	- hands and feet
	- 
- persistence
	- heart
	- tenacity to adhere to course of action
	- many goals in life call for marathons and not just sprints


   Did Esther have the persistence to see her dream through? It seems this  
question isn’t even available to ask in Esther’s case,

   persistence can only arise if one has in fact taken enough action to get to  
encounter several roadblocks over an extended period of time. Since Esther  
stopped before she even began, the question of persistence wasn’t even in  
the equation for her.

   if following through is so awesome, why don’t we all just do it all the  
time? The short answer is because it’s hard. The long answer (which also  
explains why it’s hard) is detailed below.

#### Why we don't follow through
   When it comes to thinking up what we want to do, what we need to do, or  
what other people need to do, we’re usually experts. Our ideas run wild, the  
blueprints in our heads get magically written out with not much effort, and  
the mental picture of us living our dreams comes into sharp focus faster  
than we can say “cheese!
   But when it comes to actually getting off our butts and following through  
with action, we’re usually not only amateurs but also unwilling participants.  
When it comes down to it, we often couldn’t find the focus, self-discipline,  
action, and persistence needed to get the job done

ometimes we go into the battle without our heads or our spines; other
times we lack our hands and feet or our hearts. We think we could just call
on these parts to get together when we need them to, but we arrive at the
battleground only to discover that it’s never as easy as we thought it would
be.

   We don’t follow through for two main reasons: we have an entire selection  
of (1) inhibiting tactics and/or (2) psychological roadblocks that hinder us  
from finishing what we start. We’ll cover each of those in turn below

   1) setting bad goals, (2) procrastination, (3) indulging in temptations and  
distractions, and (4) poor time management, inhibit us from maximizing the  
time and energy we have toward productive ends.

   One way we procrastinate is with endless planning. We plan all the details  
of our task, and once we’re done planning, we decide that either the plan  
needs revising or the task itself needs to be scrapped. Then we plan for a  
new task, and so on—all the while conveniently unaware of the fact that all  
the planning we’re doing is also a form of procrastination. Ultimately, it’s  
something best referred to as productive procrastination because it feels  
like you’re getting somewhere, but you’re really just moving in place

   Psychological roadblocks refer to the internal, often unconscious  
mechanisms in our psyches that act as barriers to following through.  
Among these mechanisms are (1) laziness and lack of discipline, (2) fear of  
judgment, rejection, and failure, (3) perfectionism out of insecurity, and (4)lack of self awareness

   The art of following through is something that allows you to create  
the life that you actually want instead of settling for the life you  
currently have.  
It can be said to be composed of four parts: focus, self-discipline,  
action, and persistence—all equally important.  
However, it’s not just as easy as knowing you have to do it and thus  
doing it. There are powerful reasons we don’t finish what we start  
and follow through very often. These reasons can generally be split  
into two camps: inhibiting tactics and psychological roadblocks.  
Inhibiting tactics are the ways we plan against ourselves without  
even realizing it. They include (1) setting bad goals, (2)  
procrastination, (3) indulging in temptations and distractions, and  
(4) poor time management.  
Psychological roadblocks are the ways we don’t follow through  
because we are unconsciously protecting ourselves. These include  
(1) laziness and lack of discipline, (2) fear of judgment, rejection,  
and failure, (3) perfectionism out of insecurity, and (4) lack of selfawareness.
