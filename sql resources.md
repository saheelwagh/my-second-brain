Instead of developing each skill individually or working on a full-stack project, I have decided to do Interview based learning. I am using the directness approach which Scott mentions in his book. The principle of directness asserts that it’s actually while doing the thing you want to get good at when much of learning takes place. So, I want to get good at interviews and I believe directly solving the interview questions will help me to do so.
