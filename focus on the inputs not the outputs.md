Focusing on outputs leads us astray because it’s possible for good decisions to lead to bad outcomes. **In conditions of

inputs**. With this approach, you avoid the wild swings of misery and euphoria that comes with chasing outcomes.
Instead, you become curious about tweaking and perfecting the inputs.
