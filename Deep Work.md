# Planning a  project
Project planning begins at every organisation by defining tasks or choosing [[project management apps]] . 
But as an individual you first need to sharpen your deep work skills. 
The startegies covered are :
1. Desinging your [[Deep Work Startegy]] (and sticking to it).
2. Becoming [[Indistractable]]
3. Aligning your [[goals]] to your identity.
