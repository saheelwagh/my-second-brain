- main job of a plumber is to make sure that a certain amount of water (or any other liquids for that matter) can transfer efficiently from point A to point B without any leakage. 
- Think of your goals as the amount of water you have at point A. If that amount of water arrives at point B intact, without any (or at least minimum) reduction in volume, that means you have achieved your goal. 
- What are the things you should pay attention to in order for that to happen? Well, again, this is oversimplifying and i’m not a plumber myself, but let’s try to think about this problem using common sense shall we?  

1. The pipe -> if thin -> takes longer to transfer water
2. use the shortest path. -> don't use unnecessary tangents
3. [[realistic to-do lists]] todo list that maps out actual progress.
	1. if not broken down to daily action items, it will not get done 
4. feedback and review whether getting closer to the desired outcome
5.
