As Marcus Buckingham argues in his book [_Go Put Your Strengths to Work_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/235139.Go_Put_Your_Strengths_to_Work), the problem begins with our narrow definition of strengths and weaknesses. If you’re good at writing, then that’s a strength. If you’re bad at public speaking, that’s your weakness. But Buckingham suggests a better approach. **Rather than thinking of what you excel at, it would be better to ask, “What energizes you?**

Weaknesses are managable
