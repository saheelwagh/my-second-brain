1. Don't worry about quality till 100 content pieces 
2. Audience is the mvp. Chase a 5k list before selling
3. Imitation is a great starting point. My early writing had a bit too much influence from [Steve Pavlina](https://stevepavlina.com/), for instance
4. Two factors influence this insecurity. **The first is that your taste inevitably outstrips your ability. You can always appreciate writing that is better, smarter, more thorough and incisive than your own.** You get better as a writer — but improve even more as a reader. The confidence gap widens, even as your absolute abilities grow.
5. Don't write alone
6. **Look for extreme bets.**  Most writing will never be read by anyone. Of what remains, the vast majority will stay confined to the narrow corner of the internet they were birthed into. **But a few pieces will travel widely. It only takes a few such pieces to build a career.**
7. Writing has a large random component; thus the optimal strategy tends to be prolificacy.
8. Use writing to build indirect opportunities
