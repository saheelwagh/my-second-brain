[[My Writing]]
1.  Write atomic essay
2.  Post image to twitter
3.  Turn into a

1.  The highest-performing Twitter threads are always hyper-condensed lists jam-packed with information. “7 lessons I learned building my first startup,” for example
2.  If your article is referencing other articles, case studies, data, or just building on someone else’s idea (in their content), then turning your article into a Thread is an effective way of 1) showing your sources, and 2) making it easy for readers to navigate to the content you’re referencing.
3.  the truth is, most readers don’t “read” Threads.
4.  They skim them — and THEN decide whether or not they want to spend 30–45 seconds reading the Thread with focus.
5.  So listicles, bullets, actionable tips, walkthrough guides, all these formats are great for Threads

5.  Answser relevant question on qoura → atomic essay + image

1.  gets listed in googloe results
2.  hence establish mastery by answering in your domain

7.  Turn answer (essay into medium article)

1.  SEO → same as any big magazine
2.  Utilize the paywall
3.  _Note: If you want to see real growth on Medium, you need to 1) ALSO be submitting your content to publications there (otherwise your reach will be minimal), 2) publish 5–7 days per week (publishing 1x per week or 1x per month just doesn’t get you very far — Medium is a volume game), and 3) stay consistent for 2+ years. It’s a GRIND._

9.  _Publish on linkedin_

1.  _what most new connections on LinkedIn do when they connect with you is they:_

3.  _Skim your work history/accomplishments_
4.  _And finally…. browse your status updates/articles._
5.  _“Hey Cole, I was just reading your article <title>, and I had no idea you were a gamer! I was a gamer myself back in the day. Anyway, I see you have a ghostwriting firm now, and I have been looking for someone to help me with my own content. Would you be free to jump on a call this week?”_

11.  Publish on your blog, video, podcast anything.
12.  Order in which you publish does not matter. Just optimize your workflow

1.  ignore the seo game
2.  target the relevant audience. Start with ONE platform

14.  Use socialfire
