Fast-moving companies need articulate big thinkers. Thinking big means seeing the big picture, setting the right goals, and envisioning not only the desired state of the future but also the KPIs, systems and processes and team it takes to achieve it. Thinking small looks like just a list of KPIs. It looks like achievable and predictable goals. It looks like a document or deck that is unclear, unstructured, and hard to follow.

The sign of a good strategic thinker is not that they have just articulated the problems, goals, plans, people, and metrics of the next quarter. That’s table stakes. They also have the story, the narrative, that they’re creating. They can confidently describe what the future looks like. And it often looks like a version of something they’ve experienced in the past or from history or from another player in the market that they’ve studied. They have a model they’re building off of.  

**Always have a project that puts you out there.** A project that puts you out there could be anything — an app, a website, a blog, a product, a consulting service, a book, a side project, a hobby, a community, an event. As long as you’re consistently working on it and therefore being seen and meeting new people, it’s just a matter of time before you get lucky.
