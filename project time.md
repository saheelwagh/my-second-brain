-   **Optimism**: we assume that nothing (or at least very little) will go wrong
-   **Scope**: we forget that there’s more to the project (prep work, follow up)
-   **Energy**: we either underestimate the effort it will require, or overestimate the energy we will have available
-   **Chance**: we can’t account for all the unexpected variables (2020, anyone?)

[[Project Driven Life]]

1. Block time for projects in your calendar
2. Things will take as long as they take. It’s the doing that matters — so rather than stress about how much you have to do, why not celebrate the time you have to work on what’s important?  
3. WHichever project is currently ongoing, make it 
	1. meaningful
	2. rewarding
	3. doable
	4. focused

## 3. I’m Not Working for the Weekend — I’m Working for Tuesday

My first day off every week is Tuesday. My current 20-hour work schedule is to work Monday, Wednesday, and a half-day on Thursdays. Because I essentially always have a day off or half-day just around the corner, I’ve found it’s easier to motivate myself to work more efficiently each day I do work.  
  
I always felt like I was being super productive working 40 hours a week but, looking back, I probably wasn’t. There were probably more bathroom breaks, more email-checking, more getting up to get coffee or a drink of water. In my part-time role, when I sit down to work I’m basically glued to my laptop all day. True, some days I log off feeling completely exhausted, but I like that the days go by faster. There’s none of that watching-the-clock feeling, waiting for my eight hours to be up. Instead, I’m absorbed in my work and mindful of the need to get it done in the time I have to do it.
