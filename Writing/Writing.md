# The Ultimate Guide to writing online
https://perell.com/essay/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online/

-  fastetst way to accelerate your career
-  It’s the best way to learn faster, build your resume, and find peers and collaborators who can create job and business opportunities for you.
-  it compunds
-  Day and night, your content searches the world for people and opportunities. Projects, mentors, speaking gigs, job offers, pitches, investment opportunities, interview requests, podcast appearances, and invitations to special events. It all starts with sharing ideas online.
-  u already have the tools
-  ve interviewed more than 70 of the world’s most interesting people on my [North Star Podcast](http://perell.com/podcast/), built a [weekly email newsletter](https://perell.com/join) with almost 10,000 subscribers, and my most popular articles, such as [_What the Hell is Going On?_](https://perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on)_,_ have been read more than 100,000 times. I’ve done all this in just a couple of years.
-  7 components

1. Age of leverage
2. Make your serendipity vehicle
3. Create your online home
4. set up your distribvution system
5. Learn to write clearly and persuasively
6. connect with anyone
7. Build your personal monopoly

If you are ready to dive straight into the writing revolution, there’s no better way than my online course [_Write of Passage_](https://www.writeofpassage.school/). It dives deeper into each of these topics with live instruction, a cohort of peers, a powerful 5-week accountability structure, and feedback on each stage of your writing journey.

- Age of leverage
	- force multiplier
	- Invest in your future. Whether you want to become an author or an entrepreneur, you should start writing online. No matter what kind of book you want to write or what kind of company you want to start, it pays to have a smart and targeted audience.
	- If you plan to write a book, writing online will help you develop a voice and land a publishing deal
	- if you plan to start a company, writing will help you build credibility, meet investors, and find future co-founders. People under-estimate how much work is done before you start a company: that’s when you build your network, learn what you need to know, and discover what you’re good at. The seeds are planted years before the flowers bloom.
- Create an online home
	- [  ]  set goals for refactored life based on days left to renew
	- two essntials
		- a start here page
			- answer routine visitor questions.
			-  Most readers want guidance, so give it to them. They’ll trust and appreciate your recommendations
			-  after repeated visits, once they’ve followed your advice, they may take some risks and explore your website on their own. That’s when they’ll pore through the archives and see what you do for work.
			-  
		- a curated list of your favourite articles
			- chicken and egg problem of quantity and quality
			- curation workls when you are yet to get recognized for your ideas
			- approach the source to reshare
			- ![[Pasted image 20210628080706.png]]
			
		- The problem with online writing advice
			- One school encourages people to write anything and everything. It doesn’t matter what – they’ll tell you to put your head down, hit the keyboard, and ignore everything else. The other school sells hacks: always publish on Sunday at 6:08 pm, hire a freelancer to upvote your Reddit posts, and only write about what’s trending in the news.
			- they tell you to focus either only on writing or only on distribution

		- Create your personal microphone
			- Writing well is the cost of entry, but distribution takes you to the top.
			- Do less. Concentrate your efforts. Commit to one platform and own it.
			- poor distribution, not poor content, is the most common reason why blogs don’t succeed.
			- our blog is like an island, and you need to join an archipelago. Finding a community like [_Ribbonfarm_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/01/31/the-throughput-of-learning/) or [_Less Wrong_](https://www.lesswrong.com/) is one of the fastest ways to spin up an audience.
			- And if you can’t find a community, write for a specific person with a big audience. Whether you write for a community or an individual, if you can attract the gaze of big accounts who promote your work, your audience will grow.
			- There are two kinds of distribution: discovery and stickiness
			-  My email list is my most underrated asset. Sending emails to my 10,000 subscribers is one of the highest-leverage actions I take on a weekly basis.
			-  If you want to nail the basics of SEO, you only need to stick to three simple rules: (1) publish excellent articles, (2) coin new terms such as [_Naked Brands_](http://perell.com/nakedbrands) and [_The Never-Ending Now_](http://perell.com/blog/never-ending-now), and (3) avoid competition by using an uncommon name

- Learn to write clearly and persuasively
	- Writing is the most fundamental method of communication.
		It’s a pillar of any successful career and the foundation of every other form of media. It’s the best way to clarify your logic and thinking, and the benefits extend far beyond the page. Storing and distributing text online is cheap, which means your words can be read by almost anybody, anywhere in the world.
	- develop a bias towards action
	- Expect a small number of articles to outperform the rest. The vast majority of your traffic will come from a handful of articles. Your traffic will spike and stall. It’s normal. After I published my article, [_What the_ _Hell is Going On?_](https://perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on)_,_ traffic to my website skyrocketed. My website received almost 50,000 visitors in two days, and more than 100,000 visitors during the month of March. Since then, my website has returned to its usual cadence of 20,000 visitors per month.
	- Most people have an outdated idea of what it means to be a writer. I call this the “Thoreau Model.” They think that writers are loners. They escape society, wander into the forest, and live in a cabin for three years as they pore over their sacred tome. Well, guess what. _Walden_ was published in 1854. Solitude worked well for Thoreau but it won’t work for people like you.
	- I use an [active, social, and collaborative](https://perell.com/blog/maximize-creativity) approach to writing. Most of what I “write” doesn’t even happen on the page. It happens while I’m away from the computer, when I’m in the line at the grocery store, waiting at the airport, or speaking with friends.

## The 5 Pillars of writing
- Evergreen content
	-  _Devon Zuegel said in my interview with her, writing falls into three buckets: (1) trivial things that everybody knows, (2) things that everybody knows, [but nobody around you knows], and you have a unique perspective on, and (3) stuff that nobody knows so you have to do tons of research. Direct your energy towards the second bucket.”_
	-  If you have the best summary of a popular evergreen topic, you’ll build an audience.
- quality
	- Avoid SAT words. Use simple ones instead. There are no word limits, and you can write about whatever you want. Style is important, but substance matters more. The better your ideas and the clearer you can express them, the better your writing will be. It’s that simple. Everything else is secondary.
	- Skip the usual writing books and learn copywriting.
	- Copywriters are masters of the written word. They write with clarity, energy, and simplicity, which is exactly what readers on the Internet are looking for. They write in specifics, not generalities. There’s no fluff. They get straight to the point. By writing in a persuasive, outcome-oriented (instead of academic) style, copywriters provoke responses and feedback. They rewrite and rewrite, and only hit publish once they’ve said what they wanted to say in the fewest possible words. In short, most people would improve their writing more by emulating copywriters instead of heeding the advice of famous novelists.
	- First, you should write a long sentence whenever you have a lot to say about a topic, and when you can put together a string of connected ideas that flow well together and collectively build up to the broader point you’re trying to make. Then, you stop. You shorten your sentences, so you can make your point.
		- seriously
		- it works
- specificity
	- If you write for page views, you’ll end up watering down your ideas for the masses, which will result in boring posts that intelligent people won’t want to read
	- Instead of trying to reach as many people as possible, try to tap into one narrow vein of interest that nobody else is addressing in quite the same way as you. The true magic of the Internet is its ability to attract like-minded people from far-flung places
	- 
- listening to feedback
	- The fastest way to improve the quality of your work is to accelerate your feedback loops. More feedback is generally better.
	- As a prolific online writer, I have a treasure trove of data about what people are interested in and what they ignore. With it, I can provide a better experience for my readers.
	- Don’t discount the feedback you receive from routine conversations. Test your ideas out on intelligent friends, and don’t be afraid to state the obvious. If an idea consistently surprises somebody, it’s probably good, but if people look bored or confused when you’re sharing an idea, you should either drop it or communicate the idea differently.
	- Many writers wait until they publish a blog post to share an idea with somebody. I do the opposite. I share my ideas as much as I can and run them through numerous filters. I move from conversations, to tweets, to emails, to blog posts. Each medium provides a different layer of feedback. By the time I’ve published a blog post, I’ve run the ideas through 3-5 filters,

	- 
- building your body of work
	- _ou’ve already spent 10,000 hours working on the craft you know about. And you’ve already probably spent 100 concentrated hours consuming, reading, and listening to podcasts that you can recall in your short-term memory about the topic to even consider writing. The truth is the 10 hours it takes to write something is already dwarfed by this sunk cost. If you don’t write, you are effectively stopping at the easier ask. It’s important you emphasize to yourself that you don’t need to relive the experiences it took for you to become a subject expert in order to share them.”_
	- Once you’ve developed a system for publishing at a consistent pace, you can turn your attention to building a body of work.
	- Of all the writers I know, Nick Maggiulli’s [story](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/) best illustrates the benefits of writing online. Two years ago, Nick was working at a litigation firm in Boston. He didn’t like the job, and his work didn’t engage him.


In short, you can build an online reputation in three steps:

1.  Pick a high value, emerging industry.
    
2.  Learn as much as you can.
    
3.  Share what you learn on your personal website.


- Building a personal monopoly
	- You want to be known as the best thinker in a skill or a topic. A Personal Monopoly is the unique intersection of your knowledge, personality, and skills that nobody else can compete with. Personal Monopolies aren’t found. They’re created

For example, the genesis of my own [writing course](https://www.writeofpassage.school/) came from Twitter. I tweeted that my goal for 2019 was to help 1,000 people start writing. To my surprise, the [tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1062416084693893123) struck a chord. People responded with roaring enthusiasm. Within 48 hours, I received hundreds and hundreds of messages from every corner of the globe from people like yourself who wanted to write online.
