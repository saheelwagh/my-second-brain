[[Think Like a Rocket Scientist]]
Behind every rocket unlaunched, every canvas unpainted, every goal
unattempted, every book unwritten, and every song unsung is the looming fear of failure.

Learn fast. Not fail fast

We should be celebrating lessons from failure, not failure itself. There are two
responses to negative feedback from a credible source: deny it or accept it, and every great scientist chooses the latter.
If you pay them proper attention, failures can teach us lessons we could not learn from success.

[[focus on the inputs not the outputs]]
[[make failues interesting using curiosity]]
seek [[psychological safety]] in pursuit of ambitious goals

[[advertise your failures]] The road to success is filled with potholes. You’re better off
acknowledging them than pretending they don’t exist.

HOW TO FAIL GRACEFULLY
Rocket scientists use a constellation of tools to contain failures so they don’t create a cascade of damage. For example,
they conduct thought experiments where a failure produces no tangible damage. They build in redundancies so the
mission doesn’t fail even if a component fails. They use tests to lower the stakes because failures on the ground prevent
far more disastrous ones in space. To apply this strategy, instead of rolling out an innovative policy across the whole
company, you can use one division to create your own laboratory or experiment. Testing also gives us the opportunity
to practice failure in a relatively safe environment


A : focusing on the inputs
think of a recent failure :
1.  what went wrong ?
2.  what went right ?
3.  How do you retain the good quality decisions and inputs even if the outcome was a failure?
4.  What can I learn from this?
5.   What if this failure was actually good for me?


B : How fascinating ?
