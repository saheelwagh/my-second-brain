For a long time, I thought I need more time to get more things done. I was wrong.  
_More often, it’s the mental bandwidth that people require to get things done._

You need to be appropriately engaged with whatever you are doing in the present. This means that if you are spending time with your kids, no other things should stay in your mind. When you are working on a specific project, you need to only think about that project and nothing else.  
You can only get appropriately engaged at everything you do if your mind is clear, like water. 


 You need to build a trusted system (an external brain) that can help you capture, clarify, organize and remind you of whatever you need to do at the right time, and at the right place. Without a “GTD” system, your brain will keep on reminding you, in random order, every little thing that you ought to/should do/will do at some point. 
 
 
 
An effective GTD system will improve two key dimensions: Control and Perspective.  
Excellent control ensures that you can do things right. Excellent perspective ensures that you do the right things.
