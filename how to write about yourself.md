_Eat, Pray, Love_ is one of the most popular memoirs of all time. It’s about the life of Elizabeth Gilbert, a woman who got divorced and traveled the world to find herself. There were plenty of stories about her life in the book, but here’s why the book did so well.  
The stories were about concepts people related to, not about herself. _Eat, Pray, Love_ is not a book about Elizabeth Gilbert, it’s a book about _every woman who feels trapped in their circumstances and wants to break away and go on an adventure._  
The person in the story doesn’t matter. Good stories make people identify with them. The character, protagonist, whatever, is a reflection of you.
