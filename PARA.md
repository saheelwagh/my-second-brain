There are separate use cases for a given piece of information (whether a line of text, an image, a complete note, or an entire notebook) to flow between any two of the four primary categories:

#### FROM PROJECTS

**To Areas:** sometimes what starts as a limited-time project becomes a long-term, ongoing responsibility. Your commitment to something can expand or contract over time. You might have a project to hire someone for your team, who then becomes an ongoing report to manage. You might try out a new hobby as a side project, and then commit to keeping it going indefinitely, making it an area.

**To Resources:** During the course of a project, it is common to generate all sorts of “intermediate work” (brainstorms, notes, background research, diagrams, interview notes, etc.) that has value, but may or may not make it into the final product. When you finish a project, before moving it to Archives, it’s a good idea to scan it quickly for any such material that might be useful for future projects. In my experience, this only applies to a small amount of the material for any given project, but the value it creates in the future is immense.

**To Archives**: Since our goal is rapid project turnover, this is one of the most common flows, moving completed or inactive projects to Archives for future reference.
