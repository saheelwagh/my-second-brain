Coffee ,olecules look like adenosine -> job is to slow down and sleep
coffee blocks its receptors
when you stop recaffeinating you crash
more coffee you drink -> mode adenosine produced

1. Wake up without coffee
2. first cup b/w 9.30 and 11.30
3. Last cup b/w 1.30 and 2.30

When you wake up you are flooded with cortisol
Cortisol peaks b/w 8 and 9 hence coffee works only after that

Drink it before adenosine has already binded itself

## Coffee Nap
1. Sleep clears adensoine (in 15 minutes)
2. When you wake up -> coffee ready to bind
3. Works better than just nap or just coffee . One coffee nap -> 2 hours of focus
