# We can’t wait to learn with you.

A certification is great, but community is better. Built on a cohort model, we can connect and support each other during and after the program. We’ll also celebrate our graduates with a special published doc to raise awareness about (and show off) their skills. We all get better when we work together and share our special skills and insights.  

# What are you waiting for?

Get all the details and apply [here](https://coda.io/@maria-marquis/coda-doctorate-application). I hope to see you there!  
  
  
Today, I’m happy to announce that Medium has acquired [Knowable](http://knowable.fyi/), an audio-first learning company, to bring audio capabilities to our readers, members, and creators.  
  
It’s obvious why spoken-word audio is [growing in popularity](https://link.medium.com/QiFsGYIzblb). There are times for all of us when our eyes are busy but our minds are open.  
  
The number one reason people say they listen to podcasts today is [to learn new things](https://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Edison-Research-Podcast-Consumer-2019.pdf). To better serve this need, Knowable has created a compelling new format: the audio lesson. It combines the conversational style of a podcast with the rigor of a great nonfiction book, all bundled into a bespoke app focused on helping more people build the habit of lifelong learning.  








  
  
  

# The benefits of applying these copywriting principles on a landing page

Your **goal as a website writer is to create content that offers value to the reader…think about answering the questions your customers ask. This is the main purpose of having a website.**  
A **landing page on the other hand is a targeted page that is aimed at promoting one action or offer.**  

# On a website a copywriter:

-   Uses powerful words that drive emotion. Think “discover” and “transform” — words that cause a reader to feel that they need (rather than want) what the organization offers.
-   Uses terms that offer value to the reader. Think of terms such as “how to” and “learn.” The point is to educate your reader on the benefits of your work (not to sell them), use words that achieve this result.

# On a landing page a copywriter:

-   Uses words that inspire action. The point of a landing page is to get people to buy or sign up for an email, so words such as “now” and “free” are often employed. You might also think about creating a free giveaway to offer in exchange for a subscriber’s email address, but that is the topic for another blog.
-   Less is more on a landing page. This is not the place for you to write 1,000’s of words on the benefits of your offer. A landing page is a place to sell. This is exciting for copywriters who so often are told to offer value or educate. Here sell, sell, sell! Tell a short story, include exciting imagery, and drive action in your reader.


## The Intermediate

Intermediates are people who are now ‘testing’ every new productivity app there is on the market. And with each new app they try, they will spend a whole day transferring their tasks from the original app to the new app and then the rest of the week tweaking and playing around with the new features they have.  
This is also a good practice. Testing out these new apps, while doing nothing for their productivity, teaches them what features they find useful and which elements don’t work.  
The intermediates will join forums or Facebook groups to find interesting new ideas to try out, and again, while this will do nothing to help them get their work done, it does help them see what works and what does not work.  
Rather interestingly, the intermediate stops doing a weekly planning session — they don’t see its value. The only time they will do any planning session (or weekly review) is when their system breaks down — which will always happen when no weekly planning session is done.  
It usually takes around three to four years to graduate from this level, and that’s when things become interesting.  
At this stage, people divide into two groups. The first group end up micro-managing everything in their task managers or calendar. Everything is meticulously collected into a system — most of which will be repeatedly rescheduled and the rest dumped into a project folder, never to see the light of day again. These people find themselves overwhelmed and frequently falling off the productivity wagon.  

## The Enlightened Ones

**The enlightened ones finally discover that personal productivity is about eliminating the unimportant and only focusing on work that achieves their goals.**  
You can tell who these people are because they only have a small number of tasks on their task list each day — usually, around four to five tasks. They allow nobody except themselves to control what goes on their calendars, and they block a significant amount of time off for deep focused work each day, including weekends.  
  
The enlightened ones never miss their weekly planning sessions. It’s a core part of their week, and you will find they complete these sessions either early Saturday or Sunday morning. They understand that to remain focused on the vital work and achieve their goals, they must make sure they are progressing towards them each week, and the only way to do that is to do their weekly planning sessions consistently.  
  
  
The most productive people I know have not changed any of their productivity tools for years. David Allen, for instance, has used the same task manager for twenty years. Can you imagine how fast he is using his tools after twenty years of using the same tools? Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO, has been using Apple Notes for all his productivity needs for at least ten years. Simple, and it works beautifully for him.  
  
  
You can, of course, shortcut this process considerably **if you understand that the purpose of becoming better at time management and more productive is never about being able to do more work in less time; that’s a fools goal and one you will never achieve. It’s about eliminating as many less important and unnecessary tasks and only allowing meaningful, goal-accomplishing tasks on your task list.**  
  
You do not need elaborate tools to become enlightened. You need to know what is essential and a determination to eliminate anything that does not contribute towards your higher purpose. You do not need the latest, shiniest application to achieve that.

# 5. Expect Interruptions

Schedule your week as if you expect unforseen work to be added. This way, if no extra work comes by, you have more time to relax later in the week. If new work does come, you’re prepared.  

# 6. Set Your Own Hours

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/0*IfrNkGE9CpEmFhtx.jpg)  
You can create more productive days by defining between what hours you will work. If you don’t allow work to expand into your personal time, it becomes easier to work top-heavy days.  

# 7. Make Realistic To-Do Lists

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/41/0*y9pwZgL7B51XESm9.jpg?q=20)  
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/0*y9pwZgL7B51XESm9.jpg)  
Whenever I set my daily and weekly goals, I’m careful to only add on an amount I think I can handle. If you don’t believe you can everything done today, you won’t work as hard. Setting a slightly shorter list and finishing early is best.  
  
  
**The ultimate answer is the combination of these 5 concepts.**  
Unless you can figure out a way to do one or at least a couple of these, you cannot build wealth. Or get a high-paying job  

## 1. The most important step is to get a scalable skill.

This is an absolute necessity and non-negotiable.  
  
**Scalable skills:**  

-   Building an audience on any platform like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, etc.
-   Learning to code.
-   Learning any one or a couple of business or software tools until you become a master of sorts.

Example: If you master one or more tools like Notion, Airtable, Obsidian, Roam, Zapier, Webflow, WordPress, you can productize your knowledge into a digital product that you can keep on scaling.  

-   Writing a blog in a niche that has the potential for affiliate marketing.

These are by far the most popular ones with a high success rate because a lot of people have done it and will keep doing it. These skills are evergreen.  

## 2. A bare minimum of two income streams.

And one of them has to be from a scalable skill.  
  
If you love your day job, keep it. Develop a scalable skill on the side. Choose from the ones mentioned above.  
Use one for your basic and lifestyle expenses. And blindly invest the other into index funds or a blend of equities and crypto if you are the adventurous type.  

## 3. Invest in Learning. Don’t be an Uncle Scrooge.

The right course and the right community can do wonders. Take some time to search for the good ones. You can always tell apart the good ones by the way they are promoted and how the course creator delivers value with their free content.  
I have taken a ton of courses, and I will write about them soon. At the very least, what I write can save you a ton of money and will probably help you in deciding which ones to avoid.  

## 4. You need a digital product or a high-value skill to make $100,000 per year.

Option 1: Build an audience and sell a product. (Longer and harder route)  
  
Sell $50 product to 2000 people. (or)  
Sell $500 product to 200 people. (Please don’t be scammy and over-price your product. We already have enough of those grifters.)  
Option 2: Sell a high-value skill to a few rich clients every month. (Much Shorter route)  
Example of High-value skills:  

-   Lead-generation (Through cold email or running ads)
-   SEO
-   Copywriting
-   Email Marketing
-   Running FB/Google ads to sell their products
-   Optimizing conversion funnels. (Google CRO)
-   Web design

Option 3: Build a SAAS. You should either be a coding wizard for this or use no-code tools like Bubble to build what you want.  
To build a SAAS you have to do extensive market research and the product has to be super-specific. This requires a separate article and I plan to write one later.  
Examples of Saas: Remoteok.io, Uplead.com, hypefury.com, ilo.so, etc.  

## 5. Let Your Money compound in any investment vehicle. Untouched.

This is the easiest and the dumbest of all. Yet, you will be surprised how many people just completely ignore this, thinking they can take care of it later.  
**Untouched**. That’s the key factor here. You can just stick to an index fund and still beat most people’s market returns if you just let it build its momentum. When you rely on a single source of income, this is extremely hard to do because you need to dip into your savings often.  
If you have the time and are financially savvy, choose your own investments.

## 7 Things before starting to write

1.  Your audience is your MVP asset

1.  chase 5k b4 selling

3.  Dont worry about quality till 100 essays
4.  Write what you like to read

1.  Second, imitation can be a starting point for creative success. While I don’t condone plagiarism, there’s nothing wrong with dissecting a piece of writing you like and trying to produce something similar. Often the finished product will look quite different, but learning what makes other writing work will help your own writing improve.

1.  My early writing had a bit too much influence from [Steve Pavlina](https://stevepavlina.com/), for instance.

7.  You may never feel smart enough

1.  Two factors influence this insecurity. **The first is that your taste inevitably outstrips your ability. You can always appreciate writing that is better, smarter, more thorough and incisive than your own.** You get better as a writer — but improve even more as a reader. The confidence gap widens, even as your absolute abilities grow.

10.  Don't write alone
11.  **Look for extreme bets**

1.  Most writing will never be read by anyone. Of what remains, the vast majority will stay confined to the narrow corner of the internet they were birthed into. **But a few pieces will travel widely. It only takes a few such pieces to build a career.**

1.  Writing has a large random component; thus the optimal strategy tends to be prolificacy.

14.  Use writing to build indirect oppos

## Project Driven Life

The majority of productivity advice is about the day-to-day. What tasks should you work on? When should you get up in the morning? How often should you take breaks?  
  
When I view my own life, however, the biggest differences have come from projects, not tasks. These are large, complicated efforts that span anywhere from a month to a couple of years. It’s by choosing these wisely (and actually finishing them) that I’ve seen the most significant leaps.  
  
  
I contrast projects with goals.  
A goal is your desired outcome:  

-   Lose 15 lbs.
-   Become a millionaire.
-   Learn French.

A project is a plan of action:  

-   Stick to my daily workout for thirty days.
-   Save and invest 25% of my salary for the next five years.
-   Get a tutor, buy a textbook and practice speaking weekly.

  
The difference is that goals emphasize outputs while projects emphasize inputs.  
  
A well-designed goal may be easy or impossible depending on circumstances outside of your control. A well-planned project, however, can nearly always be achieved because it depends mostly on your own commitment and effort.  
  
When I wrote my book, [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/), I didn’t focus on sales, external success, or other outcome goals. Whether it was a hit or a flop wasn’t up to me.  
I focused on what I could control. I had a year to write. I still needed to run my business, spend time with friends and family, exercise and run my life. The project was to write the best book I could within those constraints.  
  

### Lifecycle of projects

1.  Incubation

1.  When I’m itching for a project but don’t have a good one ready, I tend to settle for short ones—a month at most.

3.  Action

1.  Good projects should make you a little obsessed. Obviously, you can go overboard, but a good project should make you think about it a bit more than you’d like to. If you can’t get yourself to think about it, even when you’re working on it, reaching the finish line is unlikely.

5.  Completion

1.  I prefer to define project completion by setting a timeframe rather than an arbitrary milestone. Working on something for six months or a year, and trying to do the best I can within those constraints, works better for me than working _until_ I achieve a particular goal. Sometimes this framing isn’t possible, but I find time-constrained projects easier to stick to.

### Project provide depth to life

One advantage of organizing your life into a series of projects is that it can alter the perceived flow of time. We judge the passage of time by our memories. Distinct memories serve as landmarks of time’s passing. If you want your life to pass in a flash before you, then the surest way is to do the exact same things every day. Projects serve as landmarks in the hazy stream of our daily existence and draw out our perception of time.  
  
projects aid in achievement as well. A project tends to be large enough to allow you to accomplish things that wouldn’t happen automatically on their own.  
  
Perhaps the biggest reason is simply that a project is a reminder that life is finite. Oliver Burkeman’s book [Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.amazon.ca/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Management-Mortals/dp/0735232466/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwwsmLBhACEiwANq-tXATYVOizTgacrgLfFKhGnqiDtP3x3zNVfTRQOX4C4w5-LoiOkTftThoCqJ8QAvD_BwE&hvadid=506542448803&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9001551&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=14019547324985018595&hvtargid=kwd-1142911280872&hydadcr=25834_10174906&keywords=four+thousand+weeks&qid=1634923344&sr=8-1) breaks down a human life into weekly increments. But four thousand is still a hard-to-visualize number. Taking year-long projects as the modal value, claiming that life is around 50 projects puts things into a sharper perspective. What will be yours?

## You are overdoing

The problem is that this enthusiasm is rarely matched with execution. Attempting several pursuits at once is a recipe for accomplishing none of them. Progress requires priorities. We need to tackle projects one at a time—not try to juggle them all at once.  
  
I recently read Pete Davis’s excellent book [Dedicated](https://www.amazon.ca/Dedicated-Case-Commitment-Infinite-Browsing-ebook/dp/B08LDYGTR7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=dedicated+pete&qid=1620765439&sr=8-1). In the book, he argues against the culture of “liquid modernity,” the idea that we always need to keep our options open and avoid committing to causes, communities and projects.  
  
Davis argues that we live in a culture that prizes keeping one’s options open. It’s better to be maximally flexible, the popular reasoning goes, so that we can respond to any opportunity at a moment’s notice. Committing to anything, even for just a few months, locks away other possibilities, and is thus undesirable.  
  
the problem my overly-enthusiastic students face is more mundane. It’s more fun to think about being good at something than to actually do the work to get good. Thus we daydream, rather than take action.  
  
The solution is to pick a project and see it through. Tie yourself to making a reality manifest, not simply thinking about it.  
  
  
A side-effect of committing to one project is that you end up putting off all the rest. By the time you finally start a project, you’ve been thinking about it for awhile.  
This extra incubation time has two virtues. First, it filters out bad ideas. Since you only pursue the ideas that have stuck with you during your commitment to other projects, you end up pursuing projects you care about deeply.  
  
Second, extra time results in better plans. As you ponder a potential project, you turn over the possible difficulties in your mind. Where will you find the time? What is your precise target? What constraints will you work under? All of these questions lead to sounder plans when you finally get started.  

## Set Shorter Projects

Short commitments tend to lead to greater accomplishment than long ones. How so?  
It’s not the intention to commit that matters, but whether you follow through with it. A multi-year effort has a much higher chance at being abandoned than a three-month project does. Further, a three-month project can easily lead to another three-month effort in the same direction, provided the results from the first proved promising.  
My advice is that if you’ve never stuck through a project that wasn’t externally enforced (meaning school and work don’t count), the best place to start is one that lasts thirty days. Once you’ve done a few of these, try a three-month project.  
What about all those projects that require years to achieve? The answer is simple. Set your commitment for a short burst and give yourself the option to renew it at the end.  
If you imagine you might quit midway, then it isn’t a commitment. It’s better to pick shorter commitments you will follow through on than to make lofty promises to yourself that aren’t actually binding.

## Declutter tips

1.  Patience
2.  Switch fully into personal mode

1.  And actually it’s been wonderful. I feel like I should take a significant slice out of every year and do this sort of thing. 

## Timing your patience

### procrastination vs flow

So I’ve learned that ruling out an area of investment doesn’t rule it out for life. I can circle back to it if and when I’m ready. What may feel like a nagging “should” for many years may feel like a delightful gift further down the road. If I invest at the wrong time, I’m probably just going to waste a lot of energy.  

### Favouring the choices investments

Instead of developing a stronger tolerance for feelings of dread and anxiety, I think I’ve become more sensitive to such feelings, and I choose to honor them instead of trying to repress them.  
  
I’m not saying we need to be perfect, but I think a healthy minimum standard for one’s career path would be to make it at least 50% passion work, so at least half of your time is spent doing activities you like and appreciate. I think that’s a fairly low standard though, so personally I prefer to aim for 90%+ in a typical week. I’d say that this month I’ve been pretty close to 100% so far.  
  
I still love and enjoy the richness and variety of my work in this field after 17+ years? I credit my past self with recognizing that I would eventually outgrow an overly narrow niche, and I’m glad he was wise enough to see that flexibility was essential for my long-term happiness.

I’m also approaching the design process in a fresh and inspiring way. I’m using several AI creative tools (based on the GPT-3 language model) to help me design the workshop. The AI isn’t writing content for me. Instead I’m using it to explore the idea space more thoroughly than I otherwise would. I’ve been sharing updates about this in Conscious Growth Club for the past several weeks. I’m really enjoying this because it’s such a unique and modern experience. I like discovering where the AI is weak and where it’s strong, so I can combine its intelligence with my own to create an even better workshop. I’m well into the design process, and I really like how it’s shaping up. I’m also way ahead of schedule, much like I experienced with math classes back in the day.  
What’s especially interesting about GPT-3, at least from my perspective, is that it was trained on about 10% of the Internet, including my blog, so it knows a lot about me, my past ideas, and my writing style. Hence I can even invite it to generate extra ideas that it thinks I might conceive of.  
  
If following other people isn’t working for you, you can lead yourself to a happier life. For many people that’s the only approach that works.  
A good place to start is to set your intention. Many years ago I decided to do work that I enjoyed. I decided to run my business in a sustainably enjoyable way. A huge part of that included refusing to work with anyone I didn’t like working with. When life offered me the opposite, which it often did, I rejected those offers. I realized that I couldn’t be tempted by them if I wanted to be happy and fulfilled.  
  

## When confused, clarify intentions

Whenever you get confused, it’s often super helpful to pause and clarify your intentions. Just declare what you actually want in a sentence or two. Express it aloud or in writing. Then let it sink in and see how your body, mind, and feelings react to it.  
  
  
When we bring clarity to our minds first, we can clearly communicate our desires to reality, and reality can see that we’re being honest and respond in kind.  
  
  
You wouldn’t want to frustrate a server at a restaurant by acting perpetually confused about what to order, would you? Of course not. So why would you ever want to behave like this with life or reality? Isn’t it always going to be self-defeating? How is this pattern ever really going to help you or anyone else?  
  
Don’t sit down at a table in a restaurant to order if you’re not ready and hungry for your next meal. Just rest in the state of being not hungry yet. You can do this with goal-setting too. Instead of acting confused about what to do, just rest in the state of not being hungry for any fresh goals yet. Don’t chase after partial matches. Give your hunger some time to build up first.  
  
  
  
I don’t normally chase after goals till I’m hungry for them. I let possibilities remain in possibility space until I’m strongly attracted to something specific. I often see items on life’s menu that look like they’d be interesting to explore and experience at some point, but it’s best to wait till the hunger is there, and I really have an appetite for that specific kind of experience.  
  
  
Set intentions daily (practice this act)  
  
  
I do my best not to overthink my daily intentions. It’s almost always better to offer reality some guidance than none at all. I know that I can always change course at a moment’s notice by offering fresh guidance.  
  
What if you don’t know what you want? Just guess. Guess repeatedly. Declare what you want many times each day. Speak your intentions to an empty room – reality is always listening, and so is your brain.  
  

# What Is Better Motivational Fuel Than Stress or Anxiety? – Steve Pavlina

By stevepavlina.com8 min  
[View Original](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2021/09/what-is-better-motivational-fuel-than-stress-or-anxiety/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)  
  
  
I’ve probably spent close to 100 days of my life at Disneyland. I’ve been going there every decade since the 1970s. Not once have I ever just sat there and procrastinated. I always took lots of action. I always put many miles on my shoes. I always felt pleasantly motivated to keep taking action and having different experiences all day long.  
That made me super curious. Why is it that Disneyland is so good at motivating me to take action – all day, every day… even for [30 days in a row](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2016/11/30-days-disneyland-day-30/) without a day off and not feeling like I need a break?  
  
In other words, instead of trying to force yourself to run on a misaligned fuel source, identify the best fuel sources you’ve found so far, and inject them into your life on a much grander scale. Isn’t this what we’d like the planet to do as well – to replace nasty and stinky fuel with green and clean fuel?  
  
At Disneyland I get to make tons of micro-choices, most of which will turn out well no matter which direction I go. These kinds of conditions can be recreated in business too, starting at the [level of intention](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2021/09/when-youre-confused-clarify-your-intentions/).  
  
  
I work at a pacing that feels good to me, speeding up when I want to go faster and slowing down when I prefer a more relaxed pacing. That didn’t happen by itself, and I didn’t begin my entrepreneurial journey with this mindset. Mostly I learned this the hard way, eventually concluding that trying to get myself to work productively based on my initial default approach was just awful.  
  
  
 It was only by delving deeper into that zone of trouble and dropping the unnecessary shame and guilt about it that I found much better and longer lasting motivational fuel.  
  
 find that there’s a certain wildness to my best motivational fuel. I don’t have full control of it. I can’t just lock it into a set of fixed rules. Sometimes it will cooperate with structure, but other times it will rebel against too much structure because it loves to go with the flow, wherever that leads.  
Working with your most powerful motivational fuel takes practice and patience, and your ability to understand and predict its behavior will improve over time. Initially you may not trust it, worrying that it may be too wild, too reckless, or too irresponsible and that it might get you into trouble. And initially that may indeed seem to be true. But the more you dance with this fuel source, the more you may come to trust it.  
I felt like I had to go through a transitional phase first where this fuel source pulled me well out of my comfort zone to get me further away from my old assumptions and habits. It crushed the parts of my life that weren’t working well anyway, even though I resisted such purging at the time.  
  
When you get in tune with the flow of your best motivational fuel, life is much easier and more enjoyable. Long-standing problems finally get solved as if they were no big deal to begin with. Scarcity leaves, and abundance becomes your new reality.  
  

## Should you batch create ?

Batching your workload is one of the core ideas. Schedule into your calendar days to do specific tasks and stick to that schedule, they say. If you write blogs, write them all on a Monday. If You make YouTube videos, then shoot all the content on one day, edit on one of the other days and publish it to your channel on another day. Schedule a creative week off-grid every quarter (not possible for me) and make the week off the grid, a week that you are engaged with nature (I like the nature idea)and schedule in the business side of the creativity… (the what?)  
  
 The order is based on the one rule of thumb provided by the productivity guys.  
**This golden rule is that you should CREATE BEFORE YOU MANAGE.**

# Revising your writing clarifies your ideas

It happens all the time. You want to say something, and you think about the best way to say it. But sometimes, you don’t need to focus on the writing itself, grammar, or the words you use. You need to focus on the reason behind your message.  
To me, that’s one of the most useful aspects of writing.  
The great thing about writing is that it allows you to put your thoughts on paper (or on a screen) and look at them another way. Our ideas can sometimes lack clarity and perspective because they are trapped in our heads. Writing takes these thoughts out and places them somewhere we can see objectively.  
This process also trains our minds to use language better. Revisions make us ask:  

-   Are we being clear with our point?
-   Do our words confuse our intended audience?
-   How can we [be more persuasive](https://members.dariusforoux.com/real-influence)?

  
When you decide to write something down, whether that’s a formal business plan, proposal, or simply some freewriting in your journal, you give yourself the opportunity to improve your thinking. The problem is that most people don’t use that opportunity. They simply write down the first thing that comes to mind.  
If you want to avoid that, and you want to become more intentional with your writing, try the following process  
  
This can be used for various purposes; creating a presentation for a potential client, writing a blog post, and so forth. Outline your main idea. Then go through these three levels of writing that I adapted from [Tim Ferris](https://youtu.be/65U5byDZ55M), who made on this topic.  

1.  **Write it for yourself** — When you want to write anything, ask yourself: “What do I _really_ want to say?” For now, don’t think about other people’s opinions. Don’t try to please or impress anybody. Simply look at what goal you’re trying to accomplish. Do you want someone to act? Do you need to make an appointment? Do you want someone to buy your product? Then write in a way that achieves that goal.
2.  **Revise your message for people who care** — Not everyone cares about what you write. Too often, we try to write for those people who don’t care. Why try to impress or please? That’s a waste of time. When you revise your work, always keep in mind that the people who actually care about what you have to say matter the most.
3.  **Proof for clarity** — You never want to write in an ambiguous way. When someone reads your work and doesn’t instantly get it, your writing is simply not clear. A confused reader is a reader you’ll lose. So try asking beta-readers/audience to highlight parts that are unclear for them. And see if there are statements that are unclear to you. If you’re unsure about a word/sentence/portion, cut it out entirely or rewrite it.
