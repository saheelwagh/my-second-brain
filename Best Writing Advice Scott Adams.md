- Get better at business writing
	-  Persuasion is crucial as a writer because you’re begging readers not to click away or be distracted by social media
- Scott taught me the main technique with [business writing](https://writingcooperative.com/these-16-mistakes-caused-my-writing-to-painfully-plateau-c6573b4b3881) is simplicity. 
- -   The Dilbert creator says if you want to be funnier in your writing it comes down to the words you use. I naturally use dry words. The trick is to replace simple words with more descriptive ones.

_Dry mouth_ becomes sleep drool.  
_Earns a salary_ becomes wagie.  
_Certain_ becomes liquid confidence.  
_Laidback_ becomes barefoot genius.  
_Wife_ becomes wifey.  
_A lot_ becomes bajillion.  
_Idea_ becomes IQ orgasm.  
_Big_ becomes motherlode.  
_Perfect_ becomes immaculate conception.  
_Silly decision_ becomes kamikaze mission.  
_Dumb thinking_ becomes horse and cart thinking.  


1. The first sentence is crucial. Waste a lot of time on it.
2. Avoid putting multiple thoughts in a sentence.
3. Use active voice
