 I pushed myself to finish them in under 30–45 mins. Although I tried to write each atomic essay in under 30 mins. I must admit that some of them took about 1-hour to complete. However, the more I write, the faster I started writing and organizing my thoughts. At some point, I easily started finishing an atomic essay in under 30 mins.
