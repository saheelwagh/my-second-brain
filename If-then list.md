- make two lists: one for high-energy days and another for days when you struggle to roll out of bed.
- According to blogger and Bullet Journal enthusiast [Kara Benz](http://bulletjournal.com/better-todo-lists/), both lists should follow an “if/then” model. An entry on the first list, for example, might read, “If I have a lot of energy, then I will take a walk at lunch.” The second list should feature more mindless tasks like cleaning out your inbox, organizing your desk, or even setting aside time for a power nap.
