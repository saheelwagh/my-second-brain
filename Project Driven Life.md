The majority of productivity advice is about the day-to-day. What tasks should you work on? When should you get up in the morning? How often should you take breaks?  
  
When I view my own life, however, the biggest differences have come from projects, not tasks. These are large, complicated efforts that span anywhere from a month to a couple of years. It’s by choosing these wisely (and actually finishing them) that I’ve seen the most significant leaps.  

 contrast projects with goals.  
A goal is your desired outcome:  

-   Lose 15 lbs.
-   Become a millionaire.
-   Learn French.

A project is a plan of action:  

-   Stick to my daily workout for thirty days.
-   Save and invest 25% of my salary for the next five years.
-   Get a tutor, buy a textbook and practice speaking weekly.

  
The difference is that goals emphasize outputs while projects emphasize inputs.  
  
  
  ### Lifecycle of a project
  1. Incubation 
	  1. setle for shorter ones when not having a good big project
  2. Action
	  1. Good projects should make you a little obsessed. Obviously, you can go overboard, but a good project should make you think about it a bit more than you’d like to. If you can’t get yourself to think about it, even when you’re working on it, reaching the finish line is unlikely.
  3. Completion
	  1. I prefer to define project completion by setting a timeframe rather than an arbitrary milestone. Working on something for six months or a year, and trying to do the best I can within those constraints, works better for me than working _until_ I achieve a particular goal. Sometimes this framing isn’t possible, but I find time-constrained projects easier to stick to.


#### Projects provide depth to life
- One advantage of organizing your life into a series of projects is that it can alter the perceived flow of time. 
	- We judge the passage of time by our memories.
		-  Distinct memories serve as landmarks of time’s passing. 
		-  If you want your life to pass in a flash before you, then the surest way is to do the exact same things every day. 
			-  Projects serve as landmarks in the hazy stream of our daily existence and draw out our perception of time.  

Perhaps the biggest reason is simply that a project is a reminder that life is finite. Oliver Burkeman’s book [Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.amazon.ca/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Management-Mortals/dp/0735232466/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwwsmLBhACEiwANq-tXATYVOizTgacrgLfFKhGnqiDtP3x3zNVfTRQOX4C4w5-LoiOkTftThoCqJ8QAvD_BwE&hvadid=506542448803&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9001551&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=14019547324985018595&hvtargid=kwd-1142911280872&hydadcr=25834_10174906&keywords=four+thousand+weeks&qid=1634923344&sr=8-1) breaks down a human life into weekly increments. But four thousand is still a hard-to-visualize number. Taking year-long projects as the modal value, claiming that life is around 50 projects puts things into a sharper perspective. What will be yours?
