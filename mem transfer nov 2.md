# 7 Ways to Be Top heavy productive
[[Be Top Heavy Productive]]
If all the tips for getting things done needed to be summarized in three words, they would be, “**Do it Now.**”   
Another way to summarize this lesson in productivity would be: **make your time top-heavy**. People who get stuff done have top-heavy schedules. Chronic lateness and procrastination are the result of bottom-heavy schedules.  
  

1.  **Volume of Work**. Put most your work earlier in your schedule. This could mean working all morning while having little to do in the evenings.
2.  **Importance of Work**. Put your most important tasks first. Do the tasks that have a long-term impact before taking on the minor problems.
3.  **Difficulty of Work**. Put the hardest tasks first, when you have the most energy. I love writing articles, but it takes a great deal of energy and thought before writing each post. Putting my writing work earlier lets me write when I’m the most energetic.

# How to be Top-Heavy


  
Here are 7 ways ways you can tip the balance in your schedule:  

# 1. Start a Morning Ritual.

Wake up earlier and plan out a routine for your first hour. This will make sure you can start working right away, instead of fighting off sleepiness for the first few hours.  

# 2. Set Daily and Weekly Goals

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/0*ICm31ITi_8OnFoiV.jpg)  
I maintain a weekly and daily to-do list. Both of these lists help me chunk down the infinite number of tasks I have into something more manageable.  

# 3. Preserve Your Rest Time

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/0*5sAX681JeU_1qdCv.jpg)  
I make a commitment to take at least one day off completely each week. 
# 4. Find Your Procrastination Items

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/0*5MtFNriifwNtXsW4.jpg)  
Pick those things on your to-do list that you are most likely to procrastinate on. Then make sure to get those done first. Finishing the difficult work early on makes life less stressful.  

# 5. Expect Interruptions

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/41/0*ioFwM1w5olnLsj2O.jpg?q=20)  
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/0*ioFwM1w5olnLsj2O.jpg)  
Schedule your week as if you expect unforseen work to be added. This way, if no extra work comes by, you have more time to relax later in the week. If new work does come, you’re prepared.  

# 6. Set Your Own Hours

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/41/0*IfrNkGE9CpEmFhtx.jpg?q=20)  
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/0*IfrNkGE9CpEmFhtx.jpg)  
You can create more productive days by defining between what hours you will work. If you don’t allow work to expand into your personal time, it becomes easier to work top-heavy days.  

# 7. Make Realistic To-Do Lists

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/41/0*y9pwZgL7B51XESm9.jpg?q=20)  
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/0*y9pwZgL7B51XESm9.jpg)  
Whenever I set my daily and weekly goals, I’m careful to only add on an amount I think I can handle. If you don’t believe you can everything done today, you won’t work as hard. Setting a slightly shorter list and finishing early is best.  
  
  
**The ultimate answer is the combination of these 5 concepts.**  
Unless you can figure out a way to do one or at least a couple of these, you cannot build wealth. Or get a high-paying job  

## 1. The most important step is to get a scalable skill.

This is an absolute necessity and non-negotiable.  
  
**Scalable skills:**  

-   Building an audience on any platform like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, etc.
-   Learning to code.
-   Learning any one or a couple of business or software tools until you become a master of sorts.

Example: If you master one or more tools like Notion, Airtable, Obsidian, Roam, Zapier, Webflow, WordPress, you can productize your knowledge into a digital product that you can keep on scaling.  

-   Writing a blog in a niche that has the potential for affiliate marketing.

These are by far the most popular ones with a high success rate because a lot of people have done it and will keep doing it. These skills are evergreen.  

## 2. A bare minimum of two income streams.

And one of them has to be from a scalable skill.  
  
If you love your day job, keep it. Develop a scalable skill on the side. Choose from the ones mentioned above.  
Use one for your basic and lifestyle expenses. And blindly invest the other into index funds or a blend of equities and crypto if you are the adventurous type.  

## 3. Invest in Learning. Don’t be an Uncle Scrooge.

The right course and the right community can do wonders. Take some time to search for the good ones. You can always tell apart the good ones by the way they are promoted and how the course creator delivers value with their free content.  
I have taken a ton of courses, and I will write about them soon. At the very least, what I write can save you a ton of money and will probably help you in deciding which ones to avoid.  

## 4. You need a digital product or a high-value skill to make $100,000 per year.

Option 1: Build an audience and sell a product. (Longer and harder route)  
  
Sell $50 product to 2000 people. (or)  
Sell $500 product to 200 people. (Please don’t be scammy and over-price your product. We already have enough of those grifters.)  
Option 2: Sell a high-value skill to a few rich clients every month. (Much Shorter route)  
Example of High-value skills:  

-   Lead-generation (Through cold email or running ads)
-   SEO
-   Copywriting
-   Email Marketing
-   Running FB/Google ads to sell their products
-   Optimizing conversion funnels. (Google CRO)
-   Web design

Option 3: Build a SAAS. You should either be a coding wizard for this or use no-code tools like Bubble to build what you want.  
To build a SAAS you have to do extensive market research and the product has to be super-specific. This requires a separate article and I plan to write one later.  
Examples of Saas: Remoteok.io, Uplead.com, hypefury.com, ilo.so, etc.  

## 5. Let Your Money compound in any investment vehicle. Untouched.

This is the easiest and the dumbest of all. Yet, you will be surprised how many people just completely ignore this, thinking they can take care of it later.  
**Untouched**. That’s the key factor here. You can just stick to an index fund and still beat most people’s market returns if you just let it build its momentum. When you rely on a single source of income, this is extremely hard to do because you need to dip into your savings often.  
If you have the time and are financially savvy, choose your own investments.

## 7 Things before starting to write

1.  Your audience is your MVP asset

1.  chase 5k b4 selling

3.  Dont worry about quality till 100 essays
4.  Write what you like to read

1.  Second, imitation can be a starting point for creative success. While I don’t condone plagiarism, there’s nothing wrong with dissecting a piece of writing you like and trying to produce something similar. Often the finished product will look quite different, but learning what makes other writing work will help your own writing improve.

1.  My early writing had a bit too much influence from [Steve Pavlina](https://stevepavlina.com/), for instance.

7.  You may never feel smart enough

## Project Driven Life


  
  
I
A well-designed goal may be easy or impossible depending on circumstances outside of your control. A well-planned project, however, can nearly always be achieved because it depends mostly on your own commitment and effort.  
  
When I wrote my book, [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/), I didn’t focus on sales, external success, or other outcome goals. Whether it was a hit or a flop wasn’t up to me.  
I focused on what I could control. I had a year to write. I still needed to run my business, spend time with friends and family, exercise and run my life. The project was to write the best book I could within those constraints.  
  

### Lifecycle of projects

1.  Incubation

1.  When I’m itching for a project but don’t have a good one ready, I tend to settle for short ones—a month at most.

3.  Action

1.  Good projects should make you a little obsessed. Obviously, you can go overboard, but a good project should make you think about it a bit more than you’d like to. If you can’t get yourself to think about it, even when you’re working on it, reaching the finish line is unlikely.

5.  Completion

1.  

### Project provide depth to life


  
projects aid in achievement as well. A project tends to be large enough to allow you to accomplish things that wouldn’t happen automatically on their own.

## You are overdoing

The problem is that this enthusiasm is rarely matched with execution. Attempting several pursuits at once is a recipe for accomplishing none of them. Progress requires priorities. We need to tackle projects one at a time—not try to juggle them all at once.  
  
  
  

  

  

  


## Set Shorter Projects

Short commitments tend to lead to greater accomplishment than long ones. How so?

## Declutter tips

1.  Patience
2.  Switch fully into personal mode

1.  And actually it’s been wonderful. I feel like I should take a significant slice out of every year and do this sort of thing. 

## Timing your patience

### procrastination vs flow



### Favouring the choices investments

  
  
I still love and enjoy the richness and variety of my work in this field after 17+ years? 

I’m also approaching the design process in a fresh and inspiring way. I’m using several AI creative tools (based on the GPT-3 language model) to help me design the workshop. The AI isn’t writing content for me. Instead I’m using it to explore the idea space more thoroughly than I otherwise would. I’ve been sharing updates about this in Conscious Growth Club for the past several weeks. I’m really enjoying this because it’s such a unique and modern experience. I like discovering where the AI is weak and where it’s strong, so I can combine its intelligence with my own to create an even better workshop. I’m well into the design process, and I really like how it’s shaping up. I’m also way ahead of schedule, much like I experienced with math classes back in the day.  
What’s especially interesting about GPT-3, at least from my perspective, is that it was trained on about 10% of the Internet, including my blog, so it knows a lot about me, my past ideas, and my writing style. Hence I can even invite it to generate extra ideas that it thinks I might conceive of.  
  
If following other people isn’t working for you, you can lead yourself to a happier life. For many people that’s the only approach that works.  


## When confused, clarify intentions

 
  
  .  
  
  

  
Don’t sit down at a table in a restaurant to order if you’re not ready and hungry for your next meal. Just rest in the state of being not hungry yet. You can do this with goal-setting too. Instead of acting confused about what to do, just rest in the state of not being hungry for any fresh goals yet. Don’t chase after partial matches. Give your hunger some time to build up first.  
  
  
  
I don’t normally chase after goals till I’m hungry for them. I let possibilities remain in possibility space until I’m strongly attracted to something specific. I often see items on life’s menu that look like they’d be interesting to explore and experience at some point, but it’s best to wait till the hunger is there, and I really have an appetite for that specific kind of experience.  
  
  
Set intentions daily (practice this act)  
  
  
I do my best not to overthink my daily intentions. It’s almost always better to offer reality some guidance than none at all. I know that I can always change course at a moment’s notice by offering fresh guidance.  
  
What if you don’t know what you want? Just guess. Guess repeatedly. Declare what you want many times each day. Speak your intentions to an empty room – reality is always listening, and so is your brain.  
  

# What Is Better Motivational Fuel Than Stress or Anxiety? – Steve Pavlina

I’ve probably spent close to 100 days of my life at Disneyland. I’ve been going there every decade since the 1970s. Not once have I ever just sat there and procrastinated. I always took lots of action. I always put many miles on my shoes. I always felt pleasantly motivated to keep taking action and having different experiences all day long.  
That made me super curious. Why is it that Disneyland is so good at motivating me to take action – all day, every day… even for [30 days in a row](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2016/11/30-days-disneyland-day-30/) without a day off and not feeling like I need a break?  
  
In other words, instead of trying to force yourself to run on a misaligned fuel source, identify the best fuel sources you’ve found so far, and inject them into your life on a much grander scale. Isn’t this what we’d like the planet to do as well – to replace nasty and stinky fuel with green and clean fuel?  
  
At Disneyland I get to make tons of micro-choices, most of which will turn out well no matter which direction I go. These kinds of conditions can be recreated in business too, starting at the [level of intention](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2021/09/when-youre-confused-clarify-your-intentions/).  
  
  
I work at a pacing that feels good to me, speeding up when I want to go faster and slowing down when I prefer a more relaxed pacing. That didn’t happen by itself, and I didn’t begin my entrepreneurial journey with this mindset. Mostly I learned this the hard way, eventually concluding that trying to get myself to work productively based on my initial default approach was just awful.  
  
  
 It was only by delving deeper into that zone of trouble and dropping the unnecessary shame and guilt about it that I found much better and longer lasting motivational fuel.  
  
 find that there’s a certain wildness to my best motivational fuel. I don’t have full control of it. I can’t just lock it into a set of fixed rules. Sometimes it will cooperate with structure, but other times it will rebel against too much structure because it loves to go with the flow, wherever that leads.  
Working with your most powerful motivational fuel takes practice and patience, and your ability to understand and predict its behavior will improve over time. Initially you may not trust it, worrying that it may be too wild, too reckless, or too irresponsible and that it might get you into trouble. And initially that may indeed seem to be true. But the more you dance with this fuel source, the more you may come to trust it.  
I felt like I had to go through a transitional phase first where this fuel source pulled me well out of my comfort zone to get me further away from my old assumptions and habits. It crushed the parts of my life that weren’t working well anyway, even though I resisted such purging at the time.  
  
When you get in tune with the flow of your best motivational fuel, life is much easier and more enjoyable. Long-standing problems finally get solved as if they were no big deal to begin with. Scarcity leaves, and abundance becomes your new reality.  
  

## Should you batch create ?

Batching your workload is one of the core ideas. Schedule into your calendar days to do specific tasks and stick to that schedule, they say. If you write blogs, write them all on a Monday. If You make YouTube videos, then shoot all the content on one day, edit on one of the other days and publish it to your channel on another day. Schedule a creative week off-grid every quarter (not possible for me) and make the week off the grid, a week that you are engaged with nature (I like the nature idea)and schedule in the business side of the creativity… (the what?)  
  
 The order is based on the one rule of thumb provided by the productivity guys.  
**This golden rule is that you should CREATE BEFORE YOU MANAGE.**  

# How to Use Writing to Improve Your Thinking

# Revising your writing clarifies your ideas

It happens all the time. You want to say something, and you think about the best way to say it. But sometimes, you don’t need to focus on the writing itself, grammar, or the words you use. You need to focus on the reason behind your message.  
To me, that’s one of the most useful aspects of writing.  
The great thing about writing is that it allows you to put your thoughts on paper (or on a screen) and look at them another way. Our ideas can sometimes lack clarity and perspective because they are trapped in our heads. Writing takes these thoughts out and places them somewhere we can see objectively.  
This process also trains our minds to use language better. Revisions make us ask:  

-   Are we being clear with our point?
-   Do our words confuse our intended audience?
-   How can we [be more persuasive](https://members.dariusforoux.com/real-influence)?

  
When you decide to write something down, whether that’s a formal business plan, proposal, or simply some freewriting in your journal, you give yourself the opportunity to improve your thinking. The problem is that most people don’t use that opportunity. They simply write down the first thing that comes to mind.  
If you want to avoid that, and you want to become more intentional with your writing, try the following process  
  
This can be used for various purposes; creating a presentation for a potential client, writing a blog post, and so forth. Outline your main idea. Then go through these three levels of writing that I adapted from [Tim Ferris](https://youtu.be/65U5byDZ55M), who made on this topic.  

1.  **Write it for yourself** — When you want to write anything, ask yourself: “What do I _really_ want to say?” For now, don’t think about other people’s opinions. Don’t try to please or impress anybody. Simply look at what goal you’re trying to accomplish. Do you want someone to act? Do you need to make an appointment? Do you want someone to buy your product? Then write in a way that achieves that goal.
2.  **Revise your message for people who care** — Not everyone cares about what you write. Too often, we try to write for those people who don’t care. Why try to impress or please? That’s a waste of time. When you revise your work, always keep in mind that the people who actually care about what you have to say matter the most.
3.  **Proof for clarity** — You never want to write in an ambiguous way. When someone reads your work and doesn’t instantly get it, your writing is simply not clear. A confused reader is a reader you’ll lose. So try asking beta-readers/audience to highlight parts that are unclear for them. And see if there are statements that are unclear to you. If you’re unsure about a word/sentence/portion, cut it out entirely or rewrite it.
