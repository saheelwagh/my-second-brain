Resources are **interests** (web design, crowdfunding, woodworking, frisbee golf, bio-hacking), **themes** (psychology, politics, leadership, integrity), and **assets** (stock photos, typography links, marketing swipe file, product testimonials, code snippets). I even use lower-case titles with resource notebooks, to remind myself that they are just interests, and capital letters for areas of responsibility.
