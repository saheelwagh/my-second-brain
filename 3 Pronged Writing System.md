[[Writing]]
1.  Gather material

	1.  mine ur life history
	2.  others life
	3.  read comments
	4.  hang out with ideal audience

2.  Write

	1.  come up with a daily goal
	2.  choose a start time and stick  to it
	3.  limit urself

3.  Hone your craft

	1.  **Reading books on writing**:**
	2.  Strunk and White’s [Elements of Style](https://amzn.to/2MdkmGd), Stephen King’s [On Writing](https://amzn.to/2vyd6Ls), and Anne Lamott’s [Bird by Bird](https://amzn.to/2NRcVm5) are well-known writing classics.
	3.  Lisa Cron’s [Story Genius](https://amzn.to/2NQmCRB) is a must-have for novelists, William Zinsser’s [On Writing Well](https://amzn.to/2KCEPzr) is the nonfiction writer’s manual, and many bloggers have written a lot about the craft AND business of writing, like Darren Hardy ([ProBlogger](https://amzn.to/2AWzi74)) and Jeff Goins ([Real Artists Don’t Starve](https://amzn.to/2M9Sgf9)).
	4.  **Creating a system to study specific** _**aspects**_ **of the writing** that you want to do. (Aspiring bloggers, for instance, need to study headline-writing. So a blogger could practice writing 100 headlines a day, like Smart Blogger CEO Jon Morrow did when he was starting out.)
	5.  **Conducting an in-depth analysis** of a book, a blog, or a writer’s portfolio.

	7.  But after that, it depends:
	8.  If you’re a **novelist**, you have to figure out the components of novel-writing and work on those (ex: characterization, novel structure, themes, etc.)
	9.  If you’re a **poet**, you need to study writing elements specific to poetry: poem structures, rhyme, meter, etc.
	10.  If you’re a **blogger**, you need to work on headlines, blog structure, formatting, etc.
	11.  While reading : notes → transfer to idea hub → swipe file for url
	12.
