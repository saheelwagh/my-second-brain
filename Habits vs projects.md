However, and this is important, having a habit won’t be enough. Book-writing is not as simple as churning out a page a day.

Attention is perhaps the most constrained of all. If a project requires planning, reflection and obsession to reach completion, you’re probably limited to at most one or two efforts at a time. Anything more is going to reduce your performance sharply.
