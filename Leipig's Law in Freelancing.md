**If you’re like most freelancers — in reasonable health and living in an advanced economy — your outcomes are likely the result of three factors:**  

-   [[My proficiency in your craft]]
-   [[My marketing skills]]
-   [[My discipline]]

**Commit one hour, every week, to the individual tasks of developing your craft, your marketing skills, and your personal discipline. That’s three hours a week in total. Or half an hour a day, with Sunday off.**
