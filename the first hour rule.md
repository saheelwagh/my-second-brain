**With the First-Hour Rule, you commit to working on that tough project for the _first hour_ of each day.** When that hour is up, you stop if you want to. If you _really_ want to keep going, you do.  
  
  
Imagine you were thinking about getting a puppy. You could do a bunch of research on what breed you’re going to get, read some books on dog training, and brainstorm how you’d fit taking care of the puppy into your schedule and budget. You might _never_ get the damn puppy.  
But if someone just _gave_ you a puppy, you’d be sprung into action. You’d just figure out how to fit it into your schedule, and train it. After all, the puppy is _right there in front of you_.
