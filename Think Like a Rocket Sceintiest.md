But the most dangerous part of the interplanetary journey isn’t the six months it typically takes a spacecraft to travel from Earth to Mars when the two planets are closest to each other. Rather, it’s the six minutes of terror at the very end of that journey, when the spacecraft enters, descends, and (hopefully) lands on the surface

 

Initially, we asked the obvious questions: How can we innovate on

the flawed design of the Mars Polar Lander? How do we design a better three-legged lander to ensure a smooth landing? But these questions, as we’ll discover, weren’t the right questions to be asking.

 

This chapter examines the importance of searching for a better question instead of a better answer. In the first part of this book (“Launch”), you learned how to reason from first principles and ignite your thinking by conducting thought experiments and taking moonshots to generate radical solutions to thorny problems. But often, the question we originally conceived isn’t the best one to ask, and the first problem we identified isn’t the best one to tackle.


 

In this chapter, we’ll explore how to resist the initial framing of our questions and discover the importance of finding—rather than solving—the right problem. You’ll learn the two seemingly simple questions that salvaged the Mars Exploration Rovers mission and the strategy that Amazon used to create its most profitable division. I’ll explain what you can learn from a challenge that most Stanford students failed and why expert chess players perform poorly when they see a familiar move on the board.



 

In solving problems, we instinctively want to identify answers. Instead of generating cautious hypotheses, we offer bold conclusions. Instead of acknowledging that problems have multiple causes, we stick with the first cause that pops to mind.

 

When we immediately launch into answer mode, we end up chasing the wrong problem. When we rush to identify solutions—when we fall in love with our diagnosis—our initial answer hides better ones lurking in plain sight. When the sentence is announced first, the verdict is always the same: guilty. The difficulty lies, as John Maynard Keynes said, “not in the new ideas, but in

escaping from the old ones.

 

When we’re familiar with a problem, and when we think we have

the right answer, we stop seeing alternatives. This tendency is known as the Einstellung effect. In German, einstellung means “set,” and in this context, the term refers to a fixed mental set or attitude. The initial framing of the question—and the initial answer—both stick.

 

This approach is wildly disconnected from reality. In our adult lives, problems often aren’t handed to us fully formed. **We have to find, define, and redefine them ourselves**. But once we find a problem, our educational conditioning kicks in, launching us into answer mode rather than asking whether there’s a better problem to solve.

 

“Every answer,” Harvard Business School professor Clayton

Christensen says, “has a question that retrieves it.”11 The answer is often embedded within the question itself, so the framing of the question becomes crucial to the solution. Charles Darwin would agree. “Looking back,” he wrote in a letter to a friend, “I think it was

more difficult to see what the problems were than to solve them. 

Think of questions as different camera lenses. Put on a wide- angle lens, and you’ll capture the entire scene. Put on a zoom lens, and you’ll get a close-up shot of a butterfly. “What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning,” said Werner Heisenberg, the brains behind the uncertainty principle in

quantum mechanics

n one famous study, Jacob Getzels and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi found that the most creative art students spend more time in the preparation and discovery stage than do their less

creative counterparts.15 Problem finding, according to these researchers, doesn’t end with the preparation stage. Even after spending time viewing the problem from different angles, the more creative individuals keep an open mind as they enter the solution stage and stand ready to make changes to their initial definition of the problem.


 

This time, NASA decided to get more creative with the naming and held a Name the Rovers contest, allowing schoolchildren to

submit essays with suggestions.21 The winner among ten thousand submissions was Sofi Collins, a third-grader from Arizona, who was born in Siberia and had lived in an orphanage until her adoption by an American family: “It was dark and cold and lonely,” she wrote in her essay describing her orphanage. “At night, I looked up at the  

sparkly sky and felt better. I dreamed I could fly there. In America, I can make all my dreams come true. Thank you for the ‘Spirit’ and the ‘Opportunity.’”

 

In the end, two questions that reframed the problems ended up

producing one of the most successful interplanetary missions of all time: What if we used airbags instead of a three-legged lander? What if we sent two rovers instead of one?

 

How do you do what Adler and Goldin did and see the problem from a perspective others miss?
 

distinguish between two concepts—strategy and tactics—that are often conflated.

 

What’s more, the overwhelming majority of premature babies in Nepal were born in rural areas. Most of these babies would never make it to a hospital in the first place.

The problem, therefore, wasn’t the lack of incubators in hospitals. Rather, it was the lack of accessible infant warmers in rural areas with no access to hospitals or, for that matter, reliable electricity. The traditional solution—send more incubators to hospitals or lower their cost—wouldn’t move the needle.

In light of this experience, the Stanford team reframed the problem. Premature babies didn’t need incubators. Premature babies needed warmth. Sure, other fancy features on modern incubators, like heart-rate monitors, were helpful, but the most important challenge—the one that would have the highest impact— was keeping the baby warm as its organs developed. The device to provide warmth had to be inexpensive and intuitive so it could be used by an often-illiterate parent in a rural environment without reliable electricity.

The result was the Embrace infant warmer. It’s a small, light sleeping bag that wraps around the infant. A pouch of phase-change material—which is an innovative wax—keeps the baby at the right temperature for up to four hours. You can “recharge” the warmer in only a few minutes by putting it in boiling water. And compared with the $20,000 to $40,000 price tag of a traditional incubator, the Embrace costs only $25. By 2019, the cheap and reliable product has embraced hundreds of thousands of premature infants in over twenty countries.

 

Often, we fall in love with our favorite solution and then define the problem as the absence of that solution. “The problem is, we need a better three-legged lander.” “The problem is, we don’t have enough incubators.” In each case, we pursue technology for the sake of technology. We lose the forest for the trees, the purpose for the method, the function for the form.

 

This approach mistakes tactics for strategy. Although the terms are often used interchangeably, they refer to different concepts. A strategy is a plan for achieving an objective. Tactics, in contrast, are the actions you take to implement the strategy.

 

We often lose sight of the strategy, fixate on the tactics and the

tools, and become dependent on them. But tools, as author Neil

Gaiman reminds us, “can be the subtlest of traps.”33 Just because a hammer is sitting in front of you doesn’t mean it’s the right tool for the job. Only when you zoom out and determine the broader strategy can you walk away from a flawed tactic.
- [ ] env design to make access to right tools easy 

 

To find the strategy, ask yourself, What problem is this tactic here to solve? This question requires abandoning the what and the how and focusing on the why. The three-legged lander was a tactic, and landing safely on Mars was the strategy. The incubator was a tactic, and saving premature infants was the strategy.
 

bring outsiders into the conversation. People who don’t regularly use hammers are less likely to be distracted by the hammer sitting in front of you.

 

Once you identify the strategy, it becomes easier to play with different tactics. If you frame the problem more broadly as one of gravity—not as a flawed three-legged lander—airbags can present a better alternative. If you frame the problem more broadly as the risk involved in landing on Mars—not just as a defective lander—sending two rovers instead of one decreases risk and increases reward.


 

So they ignore it. Instead, they reframe the problem more broadly as “What can we do to make money if we start with absolutely nothing?” One particularly successful team made reservations at popular local restaurants and then sold the reservation times to those who wanted to skip the wait. These students generated an impressive few hundred dollars in just two hours.

 

But the team that made the most money approached the problem differently. The students understood that both the five-dollar funding and the two-hour period weren’t the most valuable assets at their disposal. Rather, the most valuable resource was the three-minute presentation time they had in front of a captive Stanford class. They sold their three-minute slot to a company interested in recruiting Stanford students and walked away with $650.


 

What is the five-dollar tactic in your own life? How can you ignore it and find the two-hour window? Or even better, how do you find the most valuable three minutes in your arsenal? Once you move from the what to the why—once you frame the problem broadly in terms of what you’re trying to do instead of your favored solution—you’ll discover other possibilities in the peripheries.

 

It’s also helpful to separate function from form. When we look at an object, we tend to see its function. A barometer, we think, is for measuring pressure. A hammer is for driving in nails. A box is for storing objects. But this natural inertia toward the function also gets in the way of innovation. If we can look past the function to the form, we can discover other ways that the product, service, or technology can be used. For example, if you can view the typical barometer simply as a round object, it can also be used as a weight. If you view a box as a flat platform with sides, it can also be used as a stand.


 

If you’re having a hard time switching from function to form and seeing the thumbtack box as a candle platform, there’s another

approach you can try: Reverse the box.

 

The laughs eventually turned into cheers as Fosbury proved his critics wrong and took home the gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics—by doing the exact opposite of what everyone else was doing. The Fosbury flop, as it has come to be known, is now the standard method used at Olympic high jump events. Fosbury came home to a ticker-tape parade and appeared live on the Tonight Show, where he taught Johnny Carson how to perform the Fosbury flop.

 

The serial entrepreneur Rod Drury calls this approach the

“George Costanza theory of management.”54 In an episode of Seinfeld, Costanza sets out to improve his life by doing the exact opposite of what he had done before. Drury, who founded and led the accounting software company Xero, would outsmart his far bigger competitors by asking himself, “What is the exact opposite of what an incumbent would expect us to do?” Asking this question in 2005, Drury went all in on using a cloud-based platform when his

competitors were all still stuck on desktop applications.55

 

Instead of adopting a common best practice or the industry

standard, reframe the question by asking, “What if I did the reverse?” Even if you don’t execute, the simple process of thinking through the opposite will make you question your assumptions and jolt you out of your current perspective.

## The power of flip flopping
### how to spot truth and make smarter decisions
 

It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.

—SHERLOCK HOLMES


 

Our tendency toward skewed judgment partly results from the confirmation bias. We undervalue evidence that contradicts our beliefs and overvalue evidence that confirms them. “It [is] a puzzling thing,” Robert Pirsig writes. “The truth knocks on the door and you

say, ‘Go away, I’m looking for the truth,’ and so it goes away.”4

 

No one comes equipped with a critical-thinking chip that diminishes the human tendency to let personal beliefs distort the facts. Regardless of your intelligence, Feynman’s adage holds true: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the

easiest person to fool.

 

Yet this road is often obstructed. In the modern world, we live in a

perpetual echo chamber. Although technology has torn down some barriers, it has ended up erecting others. We friend people like us on Facebook. We follow people like us on Twitter. We read blogs and newspapers that vibrate on the same political frequency. It’s easy to connect only with our tribe and disconnect from the others. Just unsubscribe, unfollow, or unfriend.

This internet-fueled tribalism exacerbates our confirmation bias. As our echo chambers get louder and louder, we’re repeatedly bombarded with ideas that reiterate our own. When we see our own ideas mirrored in others, our confidence levels skyrocket. Opposing ideas are nowhere to be seen, so we assume they don’t exist or that those who adopt them must be irrational.


 

You can also ask people who normally agree with you to disagree with you. For example, I gave trusted advisers early drafts of this book and asked them to point out not what’s right, not what they loved, but what’s wrong, what should be changed, what should be taken out. This approach provides psychological safety to those who might otherwise withhold dissent for fear of offending you.


 

Until his final breath on earth, Bohr embraced Einstein’s challenges, believing them to make his ideas stronger, not weaker. His defense of quantum mechanics was based not on fortitude but on self-doubt.

In your own life, you should find that light-filled box—the challenge to your central belief systems—and never let it go. In the end, it takes courage, humility, and determination to find the truth instead of the convenient. But it’s well worth the effort.

 

THERE’S A DIFFERENCE, as Morpheus said, between knowing the path and walking the path. Once you’ve stress-tested your ideas by

trying to prove yourself wrong, it’s now time to collide those ideas with reality in tests and experiments. As we’ll see in the next chapter, however, rocket scientists take a radically different approach to both.

## Test as you fly, fly as you test
### How to nail your next interview or product launch
 

We don’t rise to the level of our expectations. We fall to the level of our training.

MILLIONS OF AMERICANS had been waiting for this moment.1 A

promise made by a young president, a revolution of cosmic proportions, was about to be realized.

The launch was woefully behind schedule. Months before the official launch date, concerns had been raised about readiness. Yet, officials turned a blind eye and hoped the glaring problems would somehow correct themselves. They were advised to delay or abort the launch altogether, but they passed. Stress tests performed just one day before the launch date revealed a lingering flaw that could compromise the entire mission.

But the test results were ignored. In a rush to launch by the tight deadline, officials pulled the trigger. As the data began to flow in, the engineers’ screens told a rapidly unfolding life-and-death story. They watched, with jaws dropped, as everything turned red.

 

THIS WAS NO rocket launch. Instead, it was the unveiling of healthcare.gov—a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act—a

landmark piece of legislation enacted during President Barack Obama’s term to provide affordable health insurance to Americans.

 

Rockets and websites are different beasts, but they have at least one thing in common. They’ll crash unless you follow a cardinal rocket-science principle called test as you fly, fly as you test.


 

Most of our decisions in life are based not on tests, but on hunches and limited information. We launch a new product, we change careers, or we try a new marketing approach—all without a single experiment


 

Even when we conduct tests, we perform superficial dress rehearsals that double as exercises in self-deception. We conduct tests—not to prove ourselves wrong, but to confirm what we believe is true. We tweak the testing conditions or interpret ambiguous outcomes to confirm our preconception


 

In a well-designed test, outcomes can’t be predetermined. You must be willing to fail. The test must run forward to shed light on uncertainty, rather than run backward to confirm preconceptions. Feynman said it best: “If it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess is, it doesn’t make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his

name is—if it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong



 

The best way to determine an object’s breaking point is to break it. Rocket scientists try to break the spacecraft on Earth—to reveal all its flaws—before the faults reveal themselves in space.


 

Rocket science offers a way forward with a deceptively simple

principle: test as you fly, fly as you test. According to the principle, experiments on Earth must mimic, to the greatest extent possible, the same conditions in flight. Rocket scientists test the spacecraft as the spacecraft will fly. If the test is successful, the flight must take place under similar conditions. Any significant deviance between the test and the flight can cause catastrophe—whether it’s a rocket, a government website, your job interview, or your next product.

 

his approach also has the benefit of reducing uncertainty, to return to an earlier chapter. Testing can help turn unknowns into knowns. Each test, if performed under similar conditions to flight, can teach rocket scientists something new about the spacecraft and prompt them to tweak a piece of software or hardware.

 

The closest you can come to Mars on Earth is Sandusky, Ohio. The small city boasts NASA’s Space Power Facility, the world’s largest vacuum chamber. It can simulate the conditions of space travel, including high vacuums,

low pressures, and extreme temperature variations


 

The fix came from a seemingly unlikely place: bicycles. Most bicycle tires have two layers—the outer layer and an inner tube. Even if the outer layer gets punctured by road debris, the inner tube remains intact. The EDL team compared apples and oranges, copying this design for our airbags and designing a double bladder for double protection. Even if the outer bladder failed, the airbag (and therefore the lander) would survive. The new design was tested and retested until the airbags survived the punishment.


 

Testing doesn’t end after the spacecraft is launched. Even after takeoff, we have to make sure that the instruments are operating properly in the unknown and volatile environment of space before we can begin trusting them.

 

We achieve that accuracy through a process called calibration.


 

n our daily lives, we are miscalibrated far more often than we assume. We need a calibration target, preferably multiple trusted advisers, who can warn us when our reading of the events is off— when we’re looking at a green block but seeing red. Pick your calibration targets carefully, and make sure you can trust their judgment. If their judgment is off, yours will be too.

 

Testing as you fly requires a multilayered approach. Rocket scientists begin testing with the subcomponents—for example, the individual cameras that will form a rover’s vision system, as well as the cables and connectors. Once the cameras are fully assembled, the vision system is tested again as a whole.

The reason for this approach is well summarized by a Sufi teaching: “You think that because you understand ‘one’ that you must therefore understand ‘two’ because one and one make two. But

you forget that you must also understand ‘and.’”10 Components that otherwise function properly may refuse to play nice with each other after assembly. Put another way, systems may produce different effects than do the individual components standing alone.


 

As these examples show, failure to conduct systems-level testing can produce unpredictable consequences. When you make a last- minute change to a product and ship it out the door without retesting the whole thing, you’re risking disaster. When you make a change to a section of a legal brief without examining how the change interacts with the whole, you’re dancing with malpractice. When you subcontract the design of a major government program to sixty contractors but fail to test the combined system—as happened with

healthcare.gov—you’re courting catastrophe


 

Repeated exposure to problems inoculates astronauts and boosts their confidence in their ability to defuse just about any issue. When physics throws curveballs at them, their training kicks in. After Hadfield returned to Earth from a successful mission, he was asked if things had gone as planned. “The truth is that nothing went as we’d planned,” he responded, “but everything was within the scope of

what we prepared for

 

You can also take a cue from the best-selling author Tim

Ferriss.49 Most authors, in picking the title and cover design for their book, simply go with their gut or, at best, consult a few friends. The more astute ones run a survey of their audience. But Ferriss took this analysis to the rocket-science level with his first book.

To select a title, Ferriss applied the test-as-you-fly principle. He bought domain names for roughly a dozen book titles and ran a Google AdWords campaign to test click-through rates

 

typed certain keywords into a Google search related to the book’s content, an ad would pop up with the book title and subtitle that pointed to a dummy web page for a book that didn’t yet exist. Google would automatically randomize and mix and match the book titles and subtitles that were displayed to the user, allowing an objective analysis of popularity. Within a week, it became apparent that The 4- Hour Workweek title attracted by far the most attention. Ferriss took the data to his publisher, which didn’t need much convincing that the title was the right one.


 

But Ferriss didn’t stop there. To choose a cover for his book, he went to a bookstore with alternative cover designs in hand. He picked up a book from the new-arrivals section and wrapped it in one of his covers. He then sat back and watched how many times the book was picked up by unsuspecting customers, repeating the exercise for each version of the cover for thirty minutes at a time until he settled on a winner.


 

These examples hold important lessons for us all. Treat your testing instruments like your investments and diversify them. If you’re building a website, test it using different browsers and different computers. If you’re designing a children’s toothbrush, watch many children brush their teeth—lest you get the one miracle child who uses a toothbrush like an adult. If you’re deciding which job offer to take, consult multiple calibration targets. One person’s opinion might provide only a fuzzy perspective. It’s only through independent validation and multiple testing sources that you get closer to twenty- twenty vision.


 

WHETHER IT’S LAUNCHING a rocket, training for a sporting event, arguing before the Supreme Court, or designing a telescope, the

underlying principle is the same. Test as you fly—subject yourself to the same conditions you’ll experience during the flight—and you’ll soon begin to soar.

# Stage 3 : Achieve
## Nothing Succeds like failure
 

THE “FAIL FAST, fail often, fail forward” mantra is all the rage in Silicon Valley. Failure is viewed as inspirational fodder, a rite of passage, a

secret handshake shared by the insiders. Countless business books instruct entrepreneurs to embrace failure and flaunt it as a badge of honor. There are conferences, such as FailCon, dedicated to celebrating failure and FuckUp Nights, where thousands have

gathered in more than eighty-five countries to toast their failures.6 There are funerals for failed start-ups, complete with bagpipes, DJs, sponsorships by liquor companies, and slogans like “Putting the Fun

in Funeral.”7


 

it’s as dangerous to celebrate failure as it is to demonize it. Rocket scientists apply a more balanced approach to failure. They don’t celebrate it; nor do they let it get in their way.

 

What explains these counterintuitive results?

When we fail, we often conceal it, distort it, or deny it. We make the facts fit our self-serving theory rather than adjust the theory to fit the facts. We attribute our failure to factors beyond our control. In our own failures, we overestimate the role of bad luck

 

hat’s a little white lie?” you might ask. After all, putting a positive spin on failure can help us save face. But here’s the problem: If we don’t acknowledge we failed—if we avoid a true reckoning—we can’t learn anything. In fact, failure can make things worse if we get the wrong messages from it. When we attribute our failures to external factors—the regulators, the customers, the competitors—we have no reason to change course. We throw good money after bad, double down on the same strategy, and hope the wind blows in a better direction.

 

Here’s what most people get wrong about persistence. Persistence doesn’t mean repeatedly doing what’s failing. Remember the old adage about the futility of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results? The goal isn’t to fail fast. It’s to learn fast. We should be celebrating the lessons from failure—not failure itself.

 

We often speak of intelligent failures as losses. “I lost five years of my life.” “We lost millions of dollars.” But these are losses only if you call them that. You can also frame them as investments. Failure is data—and it’s often data you can’t find in a self-help book. Intelligent failures, if you pay them proper attention, can be the best teachers.

 

Changing the world one problem at a time requires delaying gratification. Most things in life are “first-order positive, second-order

negative,” as Shane Parrish writes on his website Farnam Street.37 They give us pleasure in the short term but pain in the long. Spending money now instead of saving for retirement, using fossil fuels instead of renewable energy, guzzling sugar-laden beverages instead of water are all in that category.
 

Those who get ahead in life flip this perspective. “A real advantage is conferred on people who can do things that are first-

order negative, second-order positive,” Parrish writes.39 These people delay gratification in a world that has become obsessed with it. They don’t quit simply because their rocket blew up on the launch pad, they had a bad quarter, or their audition fell flat. They reorient their calibration for the long term, not for the short.
#### Input over output
 

Focusing on outputs leads us astray because good decisions can lead to bad outcomes. In conditions of uncertainty, outcomes aren’t completely within your control. An unforeseeable dust storm can cripple a perfectly designed Martian spacecraft. A bad wind can misdirect a perfectly shot soccer ball. A hostile judge or jury can derail a great case.
 

If we engage in resulting, we reward bad decisions that lead to good outcomes. Conversely, we change good decisions merely because they produced a bad outcome. We start shaking things up, reorganizing departments, or firing or demoting people. As one study shows, National Football League (NFL) coaches change their lineup after a one-point loss, but don’t change it after a one-point win— even though these minor score differences are often poor indicators

of player performance

 

The goal, then, is to focus on the variables you can control—the inputs—instead of the outputs. You should ask, “What went wrong with this failure?” and if the inputs need fixing, you should fix them. But this question isn’t enough. You must also ask, “What went right with this failure?” You should retain the good-quality decisions, even if they produced a failure

 

With an input-focused mindset, you’re free to change your destination. Goals can help you focus, but that focus can also turn into tunnel vision if you refuse to budge or pivot from your initial path.

 

This reorientation toward inputs has another upside. If you find yourself resenting the inputs, you might be chasing the wrong output. There’s a question that frequently shows up in self-help books: What would you do if you knew that you could not fail? This isn’t the right question to ask. Instead, do as Elizabeth Gilbert does, and flip the question on its head: “What would you do even if you knew that you might very well fail? What do you love doing so much that the words

failure and success essentially become irrelevant?


 

Consider another example from the pharma industry. In 1989,

Pfizer scientists developed a new drug called sildenafil citrate. Researchers hoped the drug would expand blood vessels to treat angina and high blood pressure associated with heart disease. By the early 1990s, the drug appeared to be ineffective for its intended purpose. But the participants in the trials reported an interesting side effect—erections. It wasn’t long before researchers abandoned their initial hypothesis to pursue the astonishing alternative. And Viagra

was born

 

But failures transmit invaluable signals. Your goal should be to

pick up these signals before your competitors do. But in most environments, these signals are elusive whispers that don’t rise above the noise. If you can’t hear them, if you suppress them, or if you shed them before they stick, you can’t learn from them.

 

he supporting evidence is rock solid. Psychological safety means, in Edmondson’s words, “no one will be punished or humiliated for errors, questions, or requests

for help, in the service of reaching ambitious performance goals.

#### Advt your failures
 

Our public image is synonymous with our self-worth. We puff ourselves up and create curated portrayals of our imperfect lives. We round off the edges, airbrush the negatives, and present a perfect image to the world devoid of any failures. Even when we talk about our failures, we do so in a flattering light.

## Nothing fails like success
 

Surviving your own success can be more difficult than surviving your own failure. We must treat success like a seemingly friendly group of Greeks bearing a big, beautiful gift called a Trojan horse. We must take measures to maintain humility before the Greeks arrive. We must treat our work—and ourselves—as permanent works in progress.

 

n the end, there’s no hidden playbook. No secret sauce. The

power is there for the taking. Once you learn how to think like a rocket scientist—and nurture that thinking in the long term—you can turn the unimaginable into the imaginable, mold science fiction into

 

fact, and stretch out your hands to touch the face of God.  
The powerful play goes on, to quote Whitman again, and you may

contribute a verse.  
A new verse.  
Even a whole new story. Your story.
