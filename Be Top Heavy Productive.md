A top-heavy schedule emphasizes the start, leaving more space at the end.

## Top Heavy Strategies
1. Shift majority of work volume to the start
2. SHift most important tasks to the start
3. Do the hardest tasks first when you have the most energy.

There are three different scales you should keep in mind when asking how top-heavy your schedule is. These are on a:  

1.  **Daily Basis**. Is your work shifted earlier into the morning or late into the night?
2.  **Weekly Basis**. Are your Monday’s and Tuesday’s busiest, or are you finishing up everything Sunday night?
3.  **Long-Term Basis**. Are you doing the bulk of work on your goals now, or planning to work harder in the future? If I have a project I expect to take 4 months, I make sure the first two contain the most work.



### Steps
1. Form a [[morning ritual]]
2. Set daily and weekly goals
3. Preserve your rest time. Having a guaranteed rest day makes it easier to work hard now.  
4. Premptively identify tasks you are likely to procrastinate on. Do them when you have high energy.
5. Be [[indistractable]]
6. Make [[realistic to-do lists]]
