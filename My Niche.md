[[My Writing]]

The combination of your choices for these three elements is your niche.

Here are some examples:

-   **Productivity** (topic), written about **humorously** (style/format), for **middle-aged men** (audience).
-   **Make money online** (topic), written about in **Twitter threads** (style/format), for **college students** (audience).
-   **Gardening** (topic), written about as **markup** (style/format), for **software developers**(style/format).
-   I need to be consistent yet interesting. Dependable yet unpredictable.


# Find a lens instead
For example, the 3 main lenses which I apply to my writing are my **10+ years of corporate experience**, my experience of dealing with the **social pressures** of being a middle-class immigrant, and my challenges of dealing with **financial illiteracy**:

**Here are some questions I found useful to ask myself before deciding on what my ‘primary’ lenses are:**

-   **What professional experiences have I had / skills have I developed that could be useful for someone 5 years behind me in life?**
-   **What life lessons have I learned that could help someone 5 years behind me in life (you see the theme here)**
-   **What’s a problem I’m currently facing that I could solve in public and help others through?**

-   What feels like play to me but feels like work to others?
-   What are my ‘[unfair advantages](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ND3V1ZS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)’, i.e. insights/expertise I have, people/locations I have access to that would be hard for others to replicate?
-   Which skills/abilities do people often compliment me for?
