###### Summary of book by Sonke ahrems

# Intro 
Aimed at nonfiction writers
everyone writes
focused on improving organization of notes
what can we do better in the weeks and moths much before the production to improve the results ?
Quality of writing and ease of it depends most on work done before you choose the topic

# A. Everything that you need to know about note taking

A good structure enables you to :
- Move seamlessly from one task to other without losing sight of the bigger picture
- relieves you from the burden of keeping track of everything
- enables flow


# Experts vs planners
 Plans are rigid and inflexible
 Not good at dealing with dynamic insights
 
 Experts utilize structures. Structures enable you to work according to insights and combine ideas. 
 
 Experts are less susceptible to [[Dunning Krager Effect]] and more to [[Imposter Syndrome]]
 
 ## Lesons from GTD
 1. Everything needs to be taken care of. 
 2. Pending tasks keep buging us.
 3. Tools fail in isolation. Integrate them

# The slip Box
1. Store ideas by connecting to previously stored
2. When adding a new idea, check for connections to previous

## How to use the slip box
1. Fleeting notes. Always have something to write with in capture mode
2. Make literature notes.  Concise summary of the content. 
3. Make permanent notesThe third step is the most important. Attack the ideas at a set schedule and connect to ideas already existing in your brain. This is the main idea  of the slip box. Use [[Feynman Technique]] for this step. 
4. Save and make accessible this permanent note.
5. Develop your content piece bottom up. 
	1. Start with what you have
	2. Fill in gaps 
6. Keep building pieces on the fly. Don't wait for full tank
7. Draft should be coherent
8. Edit and proofread your manuscript

This system allows you to work on multiple projects at a time.
