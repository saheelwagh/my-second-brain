#### Best practices
1. Not too many ideas in one place
2. Come to the point quickly


##### Example of life update
Here’s a sample from [Tom Kuegler](https://medium.com/u/caa51e5ba081?source=post_page-----bffd073f6da6--------------------------------)’s newsletter :

Of course, he didn’t tell me to sign up for life updates, but after he delivered on what he promised (a 5-day email course), he started sending these. And I actually enjoy them.  
  
  
t’s such a breather from the information-rich emails I’ve been receiving. It’s like a letter from a dear friend. And it works not so much because it’s human, but because it stands out.  

# **The Inspiring Story with One Big Idea**

Here’s a sample from [Nasos Papadopoulos](https://medium.com/u/7a492e70361f?source=post_page-----bffd073f6da6--------------------------------)’ Career Caster newsletter, made for aspiring podcasters:

The formula? **Story (x) Concepts (x) Compelling Insight.** The concepts are woven into a story, and the story, delivered line by line, naturally leads to one compelling insight (not in the picture). It’s non-skimmable. It’s the kind of stuff you usually see go viral on LinkedIn, but slightly longer.  
  
[Tim Denning](https://medium.com/u/b6d641be1066?source=post_page-----bffd073f6da6--------------------------------) is also very intentional. Although his word count is usually over 500, he writes in such a compelling way and delivers value sentence after sentence, so I’m going to make him an exception. He understands a key principle in thought leadership: **give value first, and the herd will come.**  

# **The Thought-Provoking Idea For The Day**

My favorite newsletter by far is [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/subscribe/)’s.  
He publishes daily articles that are no more than 150 words and distributes them by email.  
  
He offers one thought for me to ponder throughout the day. It’s like a sprinkle of pixie dust.  
In an era of lengthy newsletters offering a barrage of information, the way to make an impact is to write short and strong. 

nstead, offer a freebie or free gift to readers who decide to sign up for your list. In online marketing, this is known as a **lead magnet.** A lead magnet uses neuroscience to redirect readers’ attention toward the problems they have and how your free resource can help solve those problems. Translation: _People love free shit._  
Here are some of the qualities of a good lead magnet:  

-   **It’s quick.** We all want instant gratification, so give me a freebie I can reap the benefits of in 15 minutes or less. (It’s for this reason that I don’t love giving people a free PDF copy of a book as a lead magnet. Asking someone to read a whole book in order to understand you is a lot.)
-   **It creates clarity and solves problems.** We all have problems we’d like to solve and shortcuts we’d like to take. Organize information so I don’t have to and you’re my new best friend.
-   **It’s inspiring.** What will downloading this lead magnet give me? Remind me of my hopes and dreams and you’ll have my attention.

-   **Written content** — This is my personal go-to, and you’ve seen stuff like this for years. Whitepapers, e-books, checklists, cheat sheets, and so on. Remember: You want a lead magnet to be something that can be consumed in under 15 minutes so that your new subscribers both feel successful and are left wanting more.
-   Focus on what valuable information you want to give your readers first, then decide what format makes the most sense for delivering this info (As well as what modality you might prefer to use). Get creative!
