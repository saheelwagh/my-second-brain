1. Choose the desired action
	1. don't write a word before answering : 
		1. why does this page exist ?
		2. serve a single action 
	2. bypass the “[paradox of choice](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice/)”
	3. 
2. Establish the big idea immediately
	1. clarity -> less than 15 ideas to establish
3. Keep the first sentence short and self-interested
4. follow up with a punchy para
5. sprinkle in some social proof
6. breed desire with a powerful CTA
	1. I get a sharp pain in my chest every time I see “learn more.”  
		It’s lazy. It’s boring. It’s a conversion killer. Honestly, it just sucks to read.  Do better.  
	2. [Gumroad uses](https://gumroad.com/features) “Start Selling” which I absolutely love. [I use](https://www.jonahmalin.com/barelyweekly) “Welcome to the good life” on my newsletter landing page which converts at a 35% clip.

## Case Studies : 
#### 1. Basecamp
We’re going to peruse through one of [Basecamp’s landing pages](https://basecamp.com/features/clients) (yeah, them again) because it expertly touches on all of the advice above.  
Here she is:  
**Headline:** Dazzle your clients.  
**First sentence:** Be partners, not adversaries.  
**Punchy paragraph:** Basecamp keeps both sides organized, everyone’s feedback on the record, and all decisions, approvals, files, tasks, deadlines, and project communications safe and centralized. You’ll make a great impression.  
**Proof point:** 3.5 million accounts signed up.  
**CTA:** Try it FREE  
Other reasons why it works:  

-   Basecamp puts the focus on _you_, not the product…“_You decide what your clients can see_”…“_Your team never has to worry about accidentally sharing something private_”… “_Get the logo you need by Monday without the back and forth_.”
-   A strong, readable font. Bolded text highlights points of emphasis. Simple colors keep the copy top of mind.
-   Plain colors and product screenshots. Zero stock photography.
-   Appeals to self-interest…“_Less email and busy-work, fewer meetings._”
-   Mobile friendly.

It’s catchy, actionable, and offers a clear value proposition. Be like Basecamp.
