# Obsidian 
All of the readable data is stored in [**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format. There are other systems, e.g. [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), where I can take my files and folders and just dump them into.

OK, time for a side note: I don’t create diagrams and flowcharts that often, but this application of [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) is very cool. Type this code into Obsidian:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts
	<br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!

```
Some people actually don’t use folders or different vaults in Obsidian at all, but just dump everything into one level. That works for a lot of people, too. I’ve almost completely stopped using folders and tags in email as I used to do that all of the time; I don’t miss that ‘[inbox zero](https://www.howtogeek.com/413507/what-is-inbox-zero-and-how-can-you-achieve-it/)‘ shit one tiny bit.

## Steps for those who are starting out with Obsidian

I strongly recommend searching in [Obsidian’s Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/) if there’s something you’re thinking of. It’s extremely well made, the community is helpful and sharing, and the developers are very responsive. Apart from _always_ getting help and from people who are kind, the forum itself is so fucking well made.

Check out some [example workflows](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/example-workflows-in-obsidian/1093) that can show you how to start to use Obsidian, as it can feel very daunting at first.


In the end, the reason why I love Obsidian (so far: you never know how something may turn out) is that it supports my existentialist world view: things change, and you constantly need to adjust for that. You snooze, you lose. And it’s about having your feelers out and see what suits you, right?

Obsidian allows me to keep different vaults and I love it. I’ve so far not hammered out exactly how I want to work, and I don’t care about that. The way I work will always be changing. I’ve very little fear with this system as it’s just too open and easy to use for fear to creep in.

Don’t forget the web-browser extension [MarkDownload – Markdown Web Clipper](https://github.com/deathau/markdown-clipper) that allows you to visit a web page, think ‘I want this in my Obsidian’, select a button, copy the resulting test, and paste it into Obsidian: voilá, Markdown applied, good to go. Reckless fucking abandon.

# Obsidian as a developer
Do you ever feel like you have the same ideas or realizations repeatedly? Do you find yourself regularly trying to remember that article someone sent you or that tool you discovered? How about the pain of context-switching?

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has solved all of these problems for me. I use Obsidian to:

-   Link together ideas
-   Build a personal knowledge wiki
-   Collect notes and resources on a topic I'm learning or writing about
-   Keep track of notes for standing meetings

You could take the same approach for projects or apps you're working on. Suddenly you can compile together links and tools related to your side project while also linking to lessons you've learned from previous apps, notes from books you've read, or meeting notes. I draw a lot of inspiration from non-technical subjects like weight training, mindfulness, music, and strategy games, so the ability to link technical ideas to non-technical concepts is especially useful to me.


Why does this matter? Whenever we're learning a new area, we're slowly putting together puzzle pieces. At some point, a lightbulb will go on where we have a blend of knowledge and experience that shows us a clearer map. Your brain gets to that point by making connections between things, and often unrelated ideas will lead to those epiphanies (like those experiences where yard work or something a family member says helps you solve a problem). Apps like Obsidian and Roam let us accelerate that process by giving us a "second brain" that will store those connections when we're not currently thinking about a subject. They also provide tools to make that note-making and linking process easier than just jotting things down in a text editor.

### Core plugins

Core features of the app like [backlinks](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks) and the [graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view) are actually just plugins that can be enabled or disabled. Here are some core plugins you might want to check out that are off by default:

-   [Audio recorder](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Audio+recorder) lets you make a recording without leaving Obsidian.
-   [Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) lets you quickly insert snippets of text into your current note.
-   [Daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) will create a new note that is automatically named with the current date.
-   [Starred notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Starred+notes) will create a star icon on the left panel, which brings up a list of starred notes.
-   [Slides](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Slides) lets you do simple presentations right inside Obsidian.

Combining plugins like daily notes and templates with custom keyboard shortcuts can really take your knowledge management game to the next level.

## How I'm Using Obsidian

I use PKM broadly and Obsidian specifically for a few different purposes:

-   Mapping out ideas in my brain (my [Developer Microskills newsletter](https://developermicroskills.com/) and my book [Guide to Tiny Experiments](https://learn.samjulien.com/guide-to-tiny-experiments) are direct results of that process)
-   Centralizing research, resources, and links on a topic or project (e.g. carpal tunnel/RSI, product launches, that work project I need to get done)
-   Taking notes on repeating meetings (an alternative to an endless Google doc)


I've found Obsidian to be the perfect place for "medium to long term" notes and ideas. I still use [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) as my "idea inbox" because it's so fast and so low friction that I can quickly write or dictate something and then immediately get back to work. Not everything I put into Drafts needs to end up in Obsidian. Notes on tasks I need to complete end up in OmniFocus and some thoughts or ideas just aren't good or irrelevant and get tossed out. Drafts is also a scratch pad for me when composing emails or Slack messages, so those get trashed as well.

For example, I often have moments of clarity about personal growth while I'm working out or doing dishes, activities that let my brain decompress. I can pop out my phone and jot something into Drafts, then the next day move it into the appropriate note in Obsidian. What's awesome about this is that, instead of constantly having the same epiphanies, I can capture those moments and then add them to a growing body of work. It's the epitome of "slow burn" instead of "heavy lift."

## Mistakes made with obsidian. As a dev
1. Adding too much structure quickly
	1. let the backlinks and graph cause the structure to emerge organically
	2. it's to use backlinks and the quick launcher (cmd-O) to organically navigate the way your brain connects ideas.
2. The other mistake I made initially was dumping too much information into Notion and later Obsidian
	1. The goal is to have my vault in Obsidian be a reflection of what's important to me and my own original thoughts, feelings, and notes on what I'm learning and reading.
