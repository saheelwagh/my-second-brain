In February 2011, German game developer Andreas Illiger released Tiny Wings to the world.  
The addictive game has sold over 10 million copies, making the shy one-man team behind it millions.  
Zero budget. No marketing. No team. Just focus.  
Andreas tried to make a game that even a one-and-a-half-year-old would enjoy.  
Being a true essentialist, he focused on one single aspect during game development.  
Andreas said “There are many destructive and negative games, so I wanted to figure out if it is possible to make a game which makes you feel happy.”  
One-and-a-half-year-olds can’t multitask, so Andreas did everything to create a very simple game that would put them in a state of joy: beautiful and uplifting colors, a perky little main character, upbeat music and the simplest gameplay mechanism he could think of.  
  
No complex leveling systems, no fancy graphics, he just absolutely nailed [one of the three key components of gamification](https://blog.captainup.com/what-is-gamification-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/): motivation.  
  
The only thing you have to do is press your finger to the screen to make the bird swoop down to use the next hill as a jump.  
This is the MAJOR flaw with to-do lists.  
**You deceive yourself into thinking you actually know in advance how much you’ll be able to get done in a given day.**  
  
**You have the choce -> dissipate energy in all dir or focus on one**
