		- some default "fixes"
			- social media
			- passive consumption
		- my suspects
			- 2-3 articles
			- 2-3 issues
			- 2-3 apps
			- basic involvement with people
		- the more addicted you are you are to instant grati, the likelier you are to give up on a pursuit
		- I probably would have continued to struggle with this if not for [[Atomic Habits]]
			- make it pleasurable
			- plateau of latent potential
		- strategy to overcome :
			- pre commit to set number of tries. Can't determine output but can determine input
			- cross out the chain
			- map a path
		-
	- not having an end goal
	- delayed communication
	- improper prioiritization

		- I realised my biggest killer is not that I don't start (late start is a topic for another day)
		  collapsed:: true
			- I start but attempt to be totally numb to emotions. Doesn't work
				- Interstitial journal template
				- makes you aware of
					- next actions -> what to do
					- emo state -> whether you are in a condition to do it or need a break
			- intention is only half the journey
			  collapsed:: true
				- u r not machine
				- mistake I see many people doing is ignoring emotions
					- of themselves and of others
			- now I take 10 min detours instead of driving on the wrong road for 2 hours
		- still does not make you foolproof to wandering ( u r not robot and wfh => likely not working from isolation)
		  collapsed:: true
			- keeps a sense of finiteness to work and reduces overwhelm
		- when mental fog clears, creative insights appear -> pic of content plan
		- distractions simultaneously increase work time and make tasks appear easier than they are. Only after actually working on it you realise the actual complexity
		- break faster
		- my today's results : v/s a typical day
