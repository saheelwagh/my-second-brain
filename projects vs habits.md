There are a few ingredients needed to make habits work well:

The behavior can become routine. If it requires complex thinking or planning, it is not a habit, by definition. Sitting down to write each morning can become a habit; the act of writing itself cannot.

1.  **The behavior must be rewarding and enjoyable.** In my essay on the [meta-stability of habits](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/03/25/permanent-habits/), I point out that many behaviors we want to turn into habits aren’t enjoyable on their own. This means that while they can become easier and more automatic, they will never entirely transform into mindless routines.
2.  **The goal requires patience more than intensity.** Many goals face diminishing returns—the first hour of weekly exercise matters more than the fifteenth. Not all goals are like this. Getting a new job, launching a start-up or passing an exam have thresholds. Under a certain limit, the return on effort is zero.


However, and this is important, having a habit won’t be enough. Book-writing is not as simple as churning out a page a day. Writing a book depends not merely on typing words, but editing, getting feedback, doing research, and obsessing a little too much about a topic that you think is important. **Many terrible books have been written under the misconception that hitting a daily word count is the hardest part of writing.**

Writing a book, then, is a project. It requires mental overhead to manage the complexity, as well as focus to push through frustration. It requires thoughtful, planned action that can never be made fully automatic.

Projects, particularly the philosophy of having a few, serial efforts, can be used to handle these difficulties.


There are three different resources that you invest in a pursuit: time, effort, and attention.

Time is the most obvious—you only have so many hours in the day. Thus, even if it doesn’t require much effort or thinking, a time-intensive habit may bump against other pursuits. Even if you could use every minute of the day productively, you might still not have enough time to do everything you’d like to.

Effort is next. With careful conditioning, habits can become less effortful, but the effort rarely goes down to zero. This non-zero effort has two effects. First, when combined with the inevitable jostles of life, it can lead to a need to rebuild old habits semi-regularly. Second, it means that even if you can conceivably fit all of your desired habits into your schedule, you may not have the effort available to do them all.

Attention is perhaps the most constrained of all. If a project requires planning, reflection and obsession to reach completion, you’re probably limited to at most one or two efforts at a time. Anything more is going to reduce your performance sharply.


The number of pursuits you can take on at once depends on where they fit on this continuum. Habit-building can shrink the effort and attention required, although rarely to zero.


Writing articles works well as a habit, provided my goal is consistency. I’ve written [over 1500 articles](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/articles/) during the last decade and a half. That’s probably two million words of published material. Few could argue that I don’t have a solid writing habit.

Yet this habit doesn’t always drive improvement. Whenever I want to make a leap in my writing to something new, I have to put in a ton of effort. Often, the habit works against improvement, rather than for it, as I have such ingrained writing behaviors that they are difficult to dislodge.

Working on books, courses, or [ultralearning efforts](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/my-projects/) are all intensive projects. They’re areas where few results came from the mindless repetition of easy work. Yet, even here, habits often undergird my efforts. One of my first steps in the [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), for instance, was establishing a studying routine. It was far from effortless, but consistency made it doable.
