# Digital Writer

Digital Writers don't run away from life and seek refuge in a cabin—they incorporate their writing into their daily lives. Digital Writers don't write by themselves (hiding away in their apartment)—they Practice In Public using social publishing platforms like Twitter, Quora, Medium, etc. Digital Writers don't guess what readers want to read about—they gather data, learn what works in real time, and iterate on a daily basis.  

## Mindset of digital writer :

1.  rapid fire feedback loop
2.  build audience as you write
3.  scale yourself


# Newsletter Format

 Newsletter Possible themes   

## Play the long game to earn your readers’ trust

  
There’s a growing epidemic of clunky newsletters that leave me no choice but to click ‘Unsubscribe’.  
A typical email newsletter comes in three to five sections that include any of the following:  

-   A short story
-   A list
-   A GIF
-   A link to a resource or tool
-   A quote
-   A call to action

## **There are too many ideas in one place**

Unlike a well-written article no more than 1,000 words long, there’s no sense of coherence. I feel the need to click the links and open new tabs, which ruins the reading experience. If I do it, my head feels full — the kind of full where I read so much but fail to absorb anything.  
  

## **t’s all about _your_ product**

Mr./Ms. Creator, I get that your newsletter is a channel for you to get clients, and I respect that. What puts me off is when you plug your product too early, or too often. The genuine truth is, I subscribed to you because, in your Call-to-Action (CTA), you promised to help me. If you do that first before asking for anything in return, I will naturally give back by recommending your content to my friends, engaging with your posts online, and eventually buying a product that is a good fit for my problem.  

## **It takes too long to get to the point**

Concise writing is the marketing skill of the century. Tell me what you want to say in one sentence. Don’t waste my time with the line-by-line hype-building. I especially don’t like it when you do this to create a hook for **your product** in the end.  

# **The Short Life Update**

Here’s a sample from [Tom Kuegler](https://medium.com/u/caa51e5ba081?source=post_page-----bffd073f6da6--------------------------------)’s newsletter :  
  
![](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:format(jpg):extract_focal()/https%3A%2F%2Fmiro.medium.com%2Fmax%2F2000%2F1*i6xzx1hlA9xzhG8d-X2RRw.png)  
  
Of course, he didn’t tell me to sign up for life updates, but after he delivered on what he promised (a 5-day email course), he started sending these. And I actually enjoy them.  
  
  
t’s such a breather from the information-rich emails I’ve been receiving. It’s like a letter from a dear friend. And it works not so much because it’s human, but because it stands out.  

# **The Inspiring Story with One Big Idea**

Here’s a sample from [Nasos Papadopoulos](https://medium.com/u/7a492e70361f?source=post_page-----bffd073f6da6--------------------------------)’ Career Caster newsletter, made for aspiring podcasters:  
  
![](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:format(jpg):extract_focal()/https%3A%2F%2Fmiro.medium.com%2Fmax%2F3424%2F1*CjmfyM0BrzyswgLh2xAuuQ.png)  
  
The formula? **Story (x) Concepts (x) Compelling Insight.** The concepts are woven into a story, and the story, delivered line by line, naturally leads to one compelling insight (not in the picture). It’s non-skimmable. It’s the kind of stuff you usually see go viral on LinkedIn, but slightly longer.  
  
[Tim Denning](https://medium.com/u/b6d641be1066?source=post_page-----bffd073f6da6--------------------------------) is also very intentional. Although his word count is usually over 500, he writes in such a compelling way and delivers value sentence after sentence, so I’m going to make him an exception. He understands a key principle in thought leadership: **give value first, and the herd will come.**  

# **The Thought-Provoking Idea For The Day**

My favorite newsletter by far is [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/subscribe/)’s.  
He publishes daily articles that are no more than 150 words and distributes them by email.  
  
He offers one thought for me to ponder throughout the day. It’s like a sprinkle of pixie dust.  
In an era of lengthy newsletters offering a barrage of information, the way to make an impact is to write short and strong.  

# The key to email marketing success? Elegance.

-   Spread yourself too thin, and you lose your audience in the process.
-   If you’re talking to smart people, don’t insult our intelligence with colors, pictures, emojis, buttons, and tons of links.
-   Stand out by contrast, _not_ by clickbait.
-   Weave your insights into a story. That’s how we learn best.
-   Say your message in the shortest possible way.



# Newsletter Action plan for 1k subscribers

 #newsletter   
 originally was turned on to online business by [Ramit Sethi](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/), a personal finance and entrepreneurship author. Ramit came out with a course in 2013 called _Zero To Launch_, which taught you how to build a business powered by online courses or other forms of intellectual property. _Zero To Launch_ has four modules:  

-   Validate a business idea,
-   Grow an audience of email subscribers through content,
-   Produce an information product, and
-   Launch your product using enrollment windows in which the doors open and then close.

One would think the “launch” part is the hardest part of this framework — but it isn’t.  
  
**The toughest part of starting an online business is growing a quality, engaged audience.** In Ramit’s course, each module has recommended benchmarks to hit before moving on. The benchmark for module 2 was to have 1,000 email subscribers. For many people, that’s a lot.  
  
**the most stripped-down version performed the best.**  
Their newsletters now look like this: Simple and clear with links to articles that may be of interest.  
  
This is why I push so much on things like writing faster. It’s not to set speed records for publishing; it’s to disarm the perception that writing is a chore. **You have to write to have an online business.** Put yourself on the hook to write every week and it’ll get easier with time.

# “An email list is too hard to build”

**This one is actually valid.** It’s harder to persuade someone to give you their email address than it is to invite them to follow you on a social media platform.  
When people join your email list, they _want_ to hear from you. Signing up for a list takes more gumption than just following a social media profile. That’s why you should build one. Luckily, there are a few things you can do to more effectively grow your email list.  

1.  Compelling lead magnet

Instead, offer a freebie or free gift to readers who decide to sign up for your list. In online marketing, this is known as a **lead magnet.** A lead magnet uses neuroscience to redirect readers’ attention toward the problems they have and how your free resource can help solve those problems. Translation: _People love free shit._  
Here are some of the qualities of a good lead magnet:  

-   **It’s quick.** We all want instant gratification, so give me a freebie I can reap the benefits of in 15 minutes or less. (It’s for this reason that I don’t love giving people a free PDF copy of a book as a lead magnet. Asking someone to read a whole book in order to understand you is a lot.)
-   **It creates clarity and solves problems.** We all have problems we’d like to solve and shortcuts we’d like to take. Organize information so I don’t have to and you’re my new best friend.
-   **It’s inspiring.** What will downloading this lead magnet give me? Remind me of my hopes and dreams and you’ll have my attention.

-   **Written content** — This is my personal go-to, and you’ve seen stuff like this for years. Whitepapers, e-books, checklists, cheat sheets, and so on. Remember: You want a lead magnet to be something that can be consumed in under 15 minutes so that your new subscribers both feel successful and are left wanting more.
-   Focus on what valuable information you want to give your readers first, then decide what format makes the most sense for delivering this info (As well as what modality you might prefer to use). Get creative!

  

1.  Set up email crm

1.  mailchimp or revue

1.    
    

4.  Promote lead magnet often

Former internet marketer Derek Halpern has a formula I like to keep in mind: 20% content creation, 80% content promotion.  
  
You’ll probably feel like a broken record. Here’s a quote to keep in mind from Derek Sivers: _“What’s obvious to you is amazing to others.”_  
  
  
One of my absolute highest-performing articles on this platform [is this one](https://writingcooperative.com/9-article-frameworks-i-use-to-repeatedly-get-published-in-fast-company-and-entrepreneur-4ebb0a009b6f). There’s loads of information, and then at the end I promote a way for readers to go deeper and take action on the material they’ve just read. It’s not a viral article, but it’s a relevant article to the person I’m trying to attract to my list.  

-   how simlicity is best for writing

Here is what took me five years to understand:  

-   The best writing ideas come from actually living life and going outside
-   Time away from writing is where the inspiration to write comes from
-   Going to work each day gives you perspectives you can write about

If all you do is lock yourself in your home office and write every day, the good shit that people want to read from your experience and view of the world will be hidden from plain sight.  

-   LinkedIn articles
-   Long-form copy on Instagram next to an image
-   Short posts on Twitter
-   This one is really crazy: **you could write a long-form article as a comment on someone’s post** who has a big audience (someone like Gary Vaynerchuk)

# How I Made $11,000 From Writing in 30 Days

If you asked me whether I would ever make money from writing, I would have said _no._ I have no special skill, gift, or even a writer to mentor me.  
In the last 30 days, I’ve made more than $11,000 from writing.  
It was after doing an audit of my expenses for the month that I realized, “Holy shit, there’s $11,000 of income just from writing!”  
So here’s the deal: If I can make money from writing, you definitely can too. The reason for this article is that the most common questions I still get are:  

1.  How do I get started?
2.  How does typing words actually make money?

So without any fluff, BS, broken promises, dreams of Ferraris and selfies with Richard Branson, I’m going to tell you the answer to these two questions after doing it successfully for more than a year.  
Ready? Let’s go.  

# From 2014–2017

Not a single dollar was made from blogging during these years.  
Let’s be clear that the start is a slow burn. But the good news is that I wasn’t just a shit writer to begin with—I was a really shit writer, and a lot of time was wasted. You can definitely do better than me by avoiding a few of the pitfalls.  

## The pitfalls:

-   Don’t start your own blog, as it wastes your time and people won’t find it
-   Write everywhere in the beginning (Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)
-   Do not ask for help from other writers until you have a library of work (no one will help you if you have three published articles to your name)
-   Pitch major publications once you have found your lane, not in the first week of starting
-   Don’t take too long to pitch major publications, though
-   Do not spend a dollar on logos, paying to boost articles, or portrait photos

By avoiding these pitfalls, you can build momentum quicker than I did.  

# Getting Started

I want to make this so easy that you can’t screw it up.  

## Pick two topics

The two I chose were entrepreneurship and personal development. Write about these two topics and nothing else.  
Make sure they are topics you know something about or at least have enough passion to research without getting bored.  

## Schedule the writing weekly

I chose Saturday at the start because it was the one day I wasn’t working. Pick the day that you know you’ll have time and set it in your calendar as a recurring event.  
**Bonus tip:** For added accountability**,** tell a mate what you have committed to and agree that you will pay them $100 if you miss a Saturday of writing. (This idea came from when I had a personal trainer and often couldn’t be assed going to the gym, but the fear of him being upset, and the loss of $35 due to cancellation, was enough to get my skinny little ass to the gym and pump those weights.)  

## Do not think about money

You can’t make any substantial amount of money from writing until you have put some time into your art.  
Technically, you could make a few bucks on somewhere like Fiver, but the work will be so uninspiring that it will likely be the cause of you giving up. Sure you could make $20 for writing an article, but that is poo change compared to the thousands you can make by getting good.  
An excellent mindset to have is to write off at least the first year. Start by doing it for free because that will test you and reveal whether you really enjoy doing it. Without the pleasure you get from writing, you’ll likely give up.  

## Try not to overdo it

Right now I could write every single day, but I purposely do not. Starting out can also make you really excited to the point where you overdo it. Overdoing it leads to you feeling as though you have run out of ideas.  
Here is what took me five years to understand:  

-   The best writing ideas come from actually living life and going outside
-   Time away from writing is where the inspiration to write comes from
-   Going to work each day gives you perspectives you can write about

If all you do is lock yourself in your home office and write every day, the good shit that people want to read from your experience and view of the world will be hidden from plain sight.  

## Use someone else’s platform

I said before not to start with your own website for a damn good reason.  
Having your own website will force you to piss fart around choosing website templates, engaging with web developers, paying for hosting, endlessly screwing around with column widths and a whole bunch of other BS that will not make you $11,000 per month later on.  
Start with someone else’s platform.  
I started on my mate from Western Australia’s Wordpress blog. He did all the SEO nonsense, marketing, and traffic watching so I could do the writing.  
Another way to start is by using a social media platform. Medium is the obvious choice, but people also forget some not-so-obvious choices:  

-   LinkedIn articles
-   Long-form copy on Instagram next to an image
-   Short posts on Twitter
-   This one is really crazy: **you could write a long-form article as a comment on someone’s post** who has a big audience (someone like Gary Vaynerchuk)

That last point is very left-of-center, but I have genuinely seen people do it. Get creative as there are so many ways you can practice the art of writing.  
The goal is to find a place where you can write without distraction and say something useful, inspiring, or entertaining consistently.  
Through that process, you find what works and what doesn’t, and if you’re lucky, you’ll get a small audience.  

# Spend a Stupid Amount of Time Writing in the Beginning

So much of my time at the start was wasted doing podcasts and promoting my work to an audience I hadn’t earned.  
Wherever you are starting from, you need to find your niche, your voice, and your unique way of putting sentences together.  
  
  
There is no substitute for doing the writing itself. If I could go back in time the way Marty McFly did in _Back To The Future_ and do one thing differently, it would be to stop being distracted by bullshit and just do the writing.  
The reason we avoid doing the writing is because it’s the hardest bit. Doing the writing, though, is what made me the $11,000 in 30 days — not anything else.  
  

# Format Your Work Like a Pro

My first articles were huge walls of text—even if you could see a bee’s dick from 100m away, you would not be able to see where a sentence began and ended.  
Insert lots of white space between your sentences. Use high-quality images and take the time to find the right photo to match with your article — remember, an image you choose is just as much a statement as the words themselves.  
If I was going back to the start I would have used much bigger, brighter, and scroll-stopping images. I would also have taken my safety pants off and used more bolding, images amongst the text, and tools that break things up.  
The key with these tools though is balance. You can also overdo it with these tools and that is twice as bad as not using them at all.  
With formatting, if you are feeling lazy, watch the work of the pros.  
  
Even only getting $10 a month from Medium makes you a paid writer and the mental shift that does to you is incredibly powerful.  
  
on’t spam them with sales pitches and just focus on sending them a link to your writing with a direct _“I can do this for you.”_  
  
One final bit of advice is not to forget the soft skills.  

-   Honesty
-   Humility
-   Kindness

[These are the skills](https://timdenning.com/get-10000-views/) that take you from earning $1000 per month, which is decent, to earning $11,000. No one wants to read the work of a writer who is in love with themselves and thinks their shit doesn’t stink.  
Be yourself in all its glory.

# Atomic Essay

 Atomic Essay Format   
  
 Atomic Essay Ultimate Guide   
 Nicolas Cole   

-   I’ve done it all, and I think there’s benefit in trying a bunch of different formats. Each “writing environment” changes the way you think about the words, sentences, and overall layout in front of you
-   For Ship 30 for 30, I actually write inside the Figma template given during onboarding. It helps me “see” exactly how long each essay should be to reach that ~300-word limit.
-   [https://atomicessays.com/](https://atomicessays.com)
-   **Atomic essays** are pieces of writing that are under 250 words. They are meant to be to the point and meaningful. Modern way to write for social media.
-   First thing first, atomic essays are 200 to 300 words, short-form writing format.
-   Atomic essays are unedited essays.
-   Moreover, I pushed myself to finish them in under 30–45 mins. Although I tried to write each atomic essay in under 30 mins. I must admit that some of them took about 1-hour to complete. However, the more I write, the faster I started writing and organizing my thoughts. At some point, I easily started finishing an atomic essay in under 30 mins.
-   As I saw from Twitter, everyone was sharing their posts on social media. I followed the same principle. After writing each atomic essay, I shared them on Twitter and Medium — and, sometimes on LinkedIn.
-   Participants were also writing around their chosen niche. Dickie explains this as, _“find 30 ways to say the same thing → so, for the 30 days, attack ‘your idea’ from 30 different angles.”_
-   I cannot say I strictly followed this rule. I created my atomic essays around 3 topics: creativity, writing tips, content creation.
-   One last thing, each participant has their own Twitter template. Therefore, I created a template for Twitter and used the same template every single day. _(If you want, you can check my atomic essays from_ [_here_](https://twitter.com/TheFinanz) _and_ [_here_](https://medium.com/the-finanz/atomic-essays/home)_.)_

 started writing atomic essays because:  

-   Firstly, I wanted to challenge myself and see if I can make it.
-   Secondly, I wanted to use atomic essays to test my ideas. Because instead of spending 10 hours on 1 idea, I spent 10 hours on 10 ideas. This way, I saw which ideas are worth investing in. Which ideas are worth creating long-form content.
-   Thirdly, writing daily helps you to find out your [creator-market fit](https://medium.com/the-finanz/before-youre-starting-content-creation-create-your-creator-market-fit-6c73557597ae) faster.
-   Lastly, I wanted to establish a regular writing habit.

## How to achieve more in a day than most ppl in week

1.  Prioritize sleep
2.  **Find a calming activity to do just before bed.** Anything that puts you in a serene state of mind will work. Reading a book while lying on my stomach is my go-to.
3.  create night ritual with pleasurable task

2 Ruthlessly prioritize. Create 2 task buckets  
I like to call these the primary and secondary buckets — the former 3 are to be achieved at any cost while the latter ones only if the primary ones are done.  
  
3 Chisel down to finsest level of details  
  
4 Cultivate task specific rituals  
  
5 make distractions invisible  
  
6 Alternate short bursts of ﻿Deep Work ﻿ and long leisure  
A 5-hour writing session after which I scrapped everything I wrote after the 2-hour mark taught me this the hard way. This is where leisure comes in.  
If sleep is the first thing toxic productivists hate, leisure is the second one. And funnily, both are instrumental to productivity. [Leisure replenishes everything deep work consumes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2863117/)— focus, mood, motivation, and mental energy.  

## How writing affects your brain

Writing is a stimulating yet strenuous activity for the brain, especially when you are working on a first draft. If you’ve ever felt muscle pain and exhaustion after physical activity, you know what I mean.  
[many parts of the brain](https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/blog/post/psychologically-speaking-your-brain-writing) become engaged. The more you write, the more a brain responds by establishing new neural connections within these regions.  
  
here are the benefits you can expect to get from writing.  

-   You develop organizational skills — from crafting and sequencing your thoughts and ideas
-   You boost your reasoning and problem-solving skills
-   You integrate a wide range of vocabulary words and grow your word bank

# How you can train your brain to write

## **Freewriting**

For starters, one of the ways you can do this is by freewriting every day for 5–10 minutes. This method works best if you don’t have a solid topic idea in mind and just want to write whatever comes to mind. You tap into your imagination and let it follow its course.  

## Reading

To get a head start, start reading the content you like the most. Doing that will activate your brain and help fill your brain with ideas. Reading also allows you to build your vocabulary and learn the art of writing.  

# All beginner writers face 10 probs. How to fix

## **#1: Distractions.**

But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  

## **#2: Over-editing.**

Writers love switching out adjectives, debating, “Should I say ‘amazing’ or ‘astounding?’”  
  
One of the first big principles we teach in [Ship 30 for 30](https://www.ship30for30.com/) is that, in your first year of writing online, you shouldn’t worry about editing at all (and we’ll explain why further in this guide).  
  
Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.  
  
But before you figure that out, editing is a waste of time.  
  

## **#3: Perfectionism.**

Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
_“It’s not ready yet.”_  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
  
  
**A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”**  
Who cares if you write and publish something that doesn’t get a lot of traction? In everything you write, you are learning. And the more you learn, the faster you will grow, the better you’ll get, and so on. Aiming for perfection isn’t productive.

# All Beginner Writers Face The Same 10 Problems (Here’s How To Fix Them)

By ship30for30.com6 min  
[View Original](https://www.ship30for30.com/post/all-beginner-writers-face-the-same-10-problems-heres-how-fix-them?utm_source=pocket_mylist)  
  
Maybe you want to start writing online, but aren’t sure which of your ideas are “good enough” to publish.  
Or maybe you’ve been working on a few drafts that are saved somewhere on your computer, but you’ve been hesitant to share them.  
I’m here to tell you, you’re not alone.  

## All beginner writers face the same 10 overarching problems.

And the reason these problems are so common is because so many writers are STUCK in the legacy world, still following “the old rules” of writing and believing they need to become some magical genius before they’re allowed to write and publish anything in the world.  
When that’s simply just not true.  
Here are the problems that hold writers back the most, along with some mental shifts to help you overcome them:  

## **#1: Distractions.**

Writers love distractions.  
It’s the easiest way to postpone doing the thing that needs to be done, which is sit down and write. “I need to do my laundry” is a common one.  
So is, “I need to give my friend a call” or “I’ve been working so hard lately, I could use a night watching Netflix.” But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  

## **#2: Over-editing.**

Writers love switching out adjectives, debating, “Should I say ‘amazing’ or ‘astounding?’”  
But the truth is, these types of edits don’t matter.  
And here’s why.  
One of the first big principles we teach in [Ship 30 for 30](https://www.ship30for30.com/) is that, in your first year of writing online, you shouldn’t worry about editing at all (and we’ll explain why further in this guide).  
Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.  
But before you figure that out, editing is a waste of time.  

## **#3: Perfectionism.**

Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
_“It’s not ready yet.”_  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
One of the biggest obstacles writers need to overcome early on is realizing that “perfect” is an unreasonable milestone. More importantly, aiming for “perfect” slows you down — so much so, that other writers who aren’t aiming for perfect end up zooming right by you.  
**A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”**  
Who cares if you write and publish something that doesn’t get a lot of traction? In everything you write, you are learning. And the more you learn, the faster you will grow, the better you’ll get, and so on. Aiming for perfection isn’t productive.  

## **#4: Procrastination.**

_“I’ll start writing tomorrow.”_  
We have a saying in Ship 30 for 30, and it goes like this: If you fall off the ship, that’s fine, but just make sure you don’t stay swimming for 2 days in a row (because your writing habit will drown and die).  
  

## **#5: Self-confidence.**

How do you build confidence in yourself as a writer?  
You write.  
**It’s so simple that it’s complicated.**  
  
The reason why writers struggle with self-confidence at the beginning of their journey is because they are still sitting on the dock, waiting, imagining. They haven’t yet confronted the brutal reality that, once they begin, they probably aren’t going to be great at writing. It’s going to take practice. So in order to overcome this fear and START gaining self-confidence, you need to rip the bandaid off and begin. The reframe here is: nobody starts out confident.  
  
Confidence is something you build as you move forward.  

## **#6: Generating ideas.**

A lot of writers have this fear that someone is going to “steal their ideas.”  
But writers who are afraid of other writers stealing their ideas are afraid _because they don’t know how to create more ideas._ Said differently: they value the ideas they have SO MUCH because they don’t have the skill of creating more ideas on command. Well, that’s why I created an [Endless Idea Generator for writers to use anytime they feel stuck](https://nicolascole77.medium.com/how-to-become-a-prolific-writer-e19535e9b04d?sk=3cb7c199071cf0e0e9206b5296e1d8d8). (I still use the Endless Idea Generator every single day in my own writing. Why? Because it works.)  

## **#7: Impostor syndrome.**

The reason writers experience Imposter Syndrome is because we are taught that writing is all about “fitting in” where readers already are.  
It’s about becoming a “better” writer than the next person — which is what leads to the feeling of being an imposter.  
I don’t believe this is a healthy path forward for writers.  
A better way of thinking about your path forward as a writer is figuring out how you can be DIFFERENT, not “better” than the competition. After all, how can you be an imposter if you created something completely different for yourself?  

## **#8: Writing consistently.**

The vast majority of writers & creators don’t have a talent problem.  
They have a consistency problem.  
It’s a cliché because it’s true.  

## **#9: Choosing a platform.**

Where’s the best place to write online?  
The honest answer to this question is: anywhere except your own blog. Instead, you want to write in social publishing environments like Twitter, Quora, Medium. Or, if you want to set up a Social Blog, I encourage you to use [Typeshare](https://typeshare.co/) (so you get the benefits of both a personal blog and social distribution).  
If you want more insight into why starting with a blog is NOT the best place to begin writing online, grab a copy of [_The Art & Business of Online Writing_](https://amzn.to/3kcpBVH).  

## **#10: Finding time to write.**

And of course, one of the biggest reasons writers don’t write is because they “don’t have time.”  
Well, here’s the thing — not just about writing, but about anything in life: when it comes to making progress on things that are important to us, you don’t “find” time. **You make time.** These hours are your Sacred Hours, and it’s your responsibility as a writer to make time where you are a) most likely to be productive, but b) least likely to be disturbed by the outside world.  
Your Sacred Hours might be early in the morning, at lunch, or at night.  
But it’s on you to pinpoint them, and then protect them.

## 7 Steps to build focused, creative workflow

1.  get creative work out the first thing in the morning

1.  Stephen Covey’s famous large glass jar metaphor comes to mind. When filling the jar, always start with the big rocks, then add the smaller pebbles, grains, sand and finally water, in that order. Do it in a different sequence, and the jar will be half-empty.

1.  On weekdays, I rise at 5 am, do my morning rituals, and then start writing by 6 am. On Saturdays, I usually wake a little later and start my writing by 9 am. On Sundays, I try not to write anymore. Instead, spend the mornings reading.

4.  have a specific goal in mind

1.  I will write for 60–75 minutes every morning, allowing a few minutes midway through my writing to stretch. This writing also includes my three-page journaling at the start, which then turbo boosts my creativity.

1.  I aim for 500–750 words per day. This means I can get one or two articles and some words on the current chapter of the book that I’m writing.

7.  Create a writing env
8.  No distractions

1.  Whenever I’m planning to write, whether an hour or four, I cut internet and email and put my phone in another room. I also lock my door so no one is allowed to enter

10.  Prep for next day's work and avoid procrastinating

1.  After my day’s writing is done, I often leave a short note of what I’ll be writing the next day. It could be a sentence or a few bullet points.

1.  The point is that the next day, I look at my screen and know what I will write about and won’t end up procrastinating and looking for distractions.

13.  Write to publish

From the outset, set an intention that your article, essay or book will be published. Then go through the process of a first draft, rewriting and finally either posting the blog or submitting the manuscript.  
  
  
We learn and grow by action and accountability. If there is no pressure to publish, then we remain nothing but amateurs.  
  
  
True, there is a lot of rubbish being published everywhere on the internet, but at least the writers are putting themselves out there. They are in the ‘arena,’ allowing themselves to be mercilessly criticized. At least, if their work is not good enough, they have the chance to learn from it.  
  
  
Reward yourself  
  

## Why we don't do what we need to do

The driving force behind our decisions in all these scenarios is motivation, and motivation is driven by [pain and pleasure](https://youtu.be/HeJPQRIhCHs). We don’t exercise because we associate pain with exercise. We don’t do our morning routines because waking up thirty minutes before our kids is painful. We don’t do our weekly planning because watching another episode of our favourite drama on Netflix is more pleasurable than looking at all the tasks we have to complete next week.  
  
As humans, we naturally gravitate towards pleasure and away from pain. It’s how we’ve survived for so long. We learn patterns, develop habits, and do things because we are motivated to follow a pleasurable life.  
  
  
If you look at all the tasks that are overdue on your to-do list now, you’ll find that around 80% of them are tasks you associate with pain. You can do a simple experiment here. When you open your email in the morning, which emails do you reply to first? It’s always the easiest and shortest ones. Why? Because when you hit the send button, you get a dopamine hit, and that is your brain’s way of giving a pleasure shot. We crave the dopamine hit, so we clear out the easy emails first.  
  
Unfortunately, that only leaves you with the emails you associate with pain. And now you’re going to say you don’t have time to reply to these because you wasted forty-five minutes sending out meaningless “thank you” emails to all those easy emails.  
  
For the tasks that you don’t ‘feel like’ doing because they are hard or will take a long time to do, you have got to learn how to turn the perceived pain of doing those tasks into something you associate with pleasure.  
  
  
You will likely have to spend part of your weekend doing these tasks or find yourself having to explain to an upset client (or boss) that you are behind on a project. Or, you will have the embarrassment of having to explain why you have failed again at accomplishing a goal you told your friends and family that you would accomplish this time.  
  
  
  
You feel like you have all the talent in the world to be successful, and you do, but you continue to cling to this identity that you’re not a ‘motivated person’. And each time you do try to clean up your act and fail, it further solidifies that identity.  

### The only src of moti that works

If you find something that _excites_ you, you have a chance to turn up that motivation dial. Finding these opportunities doesn’t guarantee you anything, but they’re your closest chance of saving grace.  
When such an opportunity arises, or you [actively search and find one](http://ayotheauthor.com/find-purpose/), jump on it and ride it as long as you can.  
  
  
You might try and fail, but those moments will at least remind you of what you’re capable of if you stick with them for at least a little bit.  
  
I had many motivational waves before I found my ultimate wave of writing.  
  
[Riding a bunch of motivational waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFkCGFm6KQ8&t=2s) and falling short **counts for something.** Even if you end up quitting, sustaining any level of motivation for any moderate length of time reminds you that you _are_ capable. Then, when you find something truly aligned to your talents and strengths, you can [ride the wave for a long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VxqcantYJE&t=1093s) — maybe even for the rest of your life.  

-   **Say yes to everything:** Go to that local event you see on a flier at a coffee shop. Download the free PDF guide from your favorite internet marketer and do what it says for once. Buy that book or course. Take any remotely positive opportunity you can.
-   **Focus on your talents and strengths:** Don’t be afraid to lean into exactly who you are. This isn’t to say you can’t do what you want, but your odds are higher if you do what you’re pre-disposed to doing. Don’t know your talents and strengths? There’s a guide at the end of this post to help you find them.
-   **Remember what you’ve been excited about:** If you are legitimately clinically depressed and have never had moments of excitement or joy, then you need professional help. But for everyone else, odds are, you’ve been excited about something in life. Think about these things and understand you already have some level of motivation in you.

  
If you start a job and start another without completing the first one, 3 things happen in the brain.  

1.  Deleting all focus of the previous work
2.  Trying to understand the new work
3.  Focus on new work

But these are very difficult things for the brain. Perhaps the word we hear all the time was said for this.

How to achieve more in a day than most ppl in week  
  
Prioritize sleep  
Find a calming activity to do just before bed. Anything that puts you in a serene state of mind will work. Reading a book while lying on my stomach is my go-to.  
create night ritual with pleasurable task  
2 Ruthlessly prioritize. Create 2 task buckets  
I like to call these the primary and secondary buckets — the former 3 are to be achieved at any cost while the latter ones only if the primary ones are done.  
  
3 Chisel down to finsest level of details  
  
4 Cultivate task specific rituals  
   
5 make distractions invisible  
  
6 Alternate short bursts of and long leisure  
A 5-hour writing session after which I scrapped everything I wrote after the 2-hour mark taught me this the hard way. This is where leisure comes in.  
If sleep is the first thing toxic productivists hate, leisure is the second one. And funnily, both are instrumental to productivity. Leisure replenishes everything deep work consumes— focus, mood, motivation, and mental energy.  
  
How writing affects your brain  
Writing is a stimulating yet strenuous activity for the brain, especially when you are working on a first draft. If you’ve ever felt muscle pain and exhaustion after physical activity, you know what I mean.  
many parts of the brain become engaged. The more you write, the more a brain responds by establishing new neural connections within these regions.  
  
here are the benefits you can expect to get from writing.  
You develop organizational skills — from crafting and sequencing your thoughts and ideas  
You boost your reasoning and problem-solving skills  
You integrate a wide range of vocabulary words and grow your word bank  
  
  
How you can train your brain to write  
Freewriting  
For starters, one of the ways you can do this is by freewriting every day for 5–10 minutes. This method works best if you don’t have a solid topic idea in mind and just want to write whatever comes to mind. You tap into your imagination and let it follow its course.  
  
Reading  
To get a head start, start reading the content you like the most. Doing that will activate your brain and help fill your brain with ideas. Reading also allows you to build your vocabulary and learn the art of writing.  
  
All beginner writers face 10 probs. How to fix  
#1: Distractions.  
But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  
  
#2: Over-editing.  
Writers love switching out adjectives, debating, “Should I say ‘amazing’ or ‘astounding?’”  
  
One of the first big principles we teach in Ship 30 for 30 is that, in your first year of writing online, you shouldn’t worry about editing at all (and we’ll explain why further in this guide).  
  
Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.  
  
But before you figure that out, editing is a waste of time.  
  
  
#3: Perfectionism.  
Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
“It’s not ready yet.”  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
  
  
A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”  
Who cares if you write and publish something that doesn’t get a lot of traction? In everything you write, you are learning. And the more you learn, the faster you will grow, the better you’ll get, and so on. Aiming for perfection isn’t productive.

All Beginner Writers Face The Same 10 Problems (Here’s How To Fix Them)  
By ship30for30.com6 min  
View Original  
  
Maybe you want to start writing online, but aren’t sure which of your ideas are “good enough” to publish.  
Or maybe you’ve been working on a few drafts that are saved somewhere on your computer, but you’ve been hesitant to share them.  
I’m here to tell you, you’re not alone.  
  
All beginner writers face the same 10 overarching problems.  
And the reason these problems are so common is because so many writers are STUCK in the legacy world, still following “the old rules” of writing and believing they need to become some magical genius before they’re allowed to write and publish anything in the world.  
When that’s simply just not true.  
Here are the problems that hold writers back the most, along with some mental shifts to help you overcome them:  
#1: Distractions.  
Writers love distractions.  
It’s the easiest way to postpone doing the thing that needs to be done, which is sit down and write. “I need to do my laundry” is a common one.  
So is, “I need to give my friend a call” or “I’ve been working so hard lately, I could use a night watching Netflix.” But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  
#2: Over-editing.  
Writers love switching out adjectives, debating, “Should I say ‘amazing’ or ‘astounding?’”  
But the truth is, these types of edits don’t matter.  
And here’s why.  
One of the first big principles we teach in Ship 30 for 30 is that, in your first year of writing online, you shouldn’t worry about editing at all (and we’ll explain why further in this guide).  
Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.

#3: Perfectionism.  
Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
“It’s not ready yet.”  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
One of the biggest obstacles writers need to overcome early on is realizing that “perfect” is an unreasonable milestone. More importantly, aiming for “perfect” slows you down — so much so, that other writers who aren’t aiming for perfect end up zooming right by you.  
A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”

How do you build confidence in yourself as a writer?  
You write.  
It’s so simple that it’s complicated.  
  
The reason why writers struggle with self-confidence at the beginning of their journey is because they are still sitting on the dock, waiting, imagining. They haven’t yet confronted the brutal reality that, once they begin, they probably aren’t going to be great at writing. It’s going to take practice.

Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.  
  
But before you figure that out, editing is a waste of time.  
  
  
#3: Perfectionism.  
Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
“It’s not ready yet.”  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
  
  
A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”  
Who cares if you write and publish something that doesn’t get a lot of traction? In everything you write, you are learning. And the more you learn, the faster you will grow, the better you’ll get, and so on. Aiming for perfection isn’t productive.

All Beginner Writers Face The Same 10 Problems (Here’s How To Fix Them)  
By ship30for30.com6 min  
View Original  
  
Maybe you want to start writing online, but aren’t sure which of your ideas are “good enough” to publish.  
Or maybe you’ve been working on a few drafts that are saved somewhere on your computer, but you’ve been hesitant to share them.  
I’m here to tell you, you’re not alone.  
  
All beginner writers face the same 10 overarching problems.  
And the reason these problems are so common is because so many writers are STUCK in the legacy world, still following “the old rules” of writing and believing they need to become some magical genius before they’re allowed to write and publish anything in the world.  
When that’s simply just not true.  
Here are the problems that hold writers back the most, along with some mental shifts to help you overcome them:  
#1: Distractions.  
Writers love distractions.  
It’s the easiest way to postpone doing the thing that needs to be done, which is sit down and write. “I need to do my laundry” is a common one.  
So is, “I need to give my friend a call” or “I’ve been working so hard lately, I could use a night watching Netflix.” But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  
#2: Over-editing.  
Writers love switching out adjectives, debating, “Should I say ‘amazing’ or ‘astounding?’”  
But the truth is, these types of edits don’t matter.  
And here’s why.  
One of the first big principles we teach in Ship 30 for 30 is that, in your first year of writing online, you shouldn’t worry about editing at all (and we’ll explain why further in this guide).  
Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.  
But before you figure that out, editing is a waste of time.  
#3: Perfectionism.  
Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
“It’s not ready yet.”  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
One of the biggest obstacles writers need to overcome early on is realizing that “perfect” is an unreasonable milestone. More importantly, aiming for “perfect” slows you down — so much so, that other writers who aren’t aiming for perfect end up zooming right by you.  
A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”  
Who cares if you write and publish something that doesn’t get a lot of traction? In everything you write, you are learning. And the more you learn, the faster you will grow, the better you’ll get, and so on. Aiming for perfection isn’t productive.  
#4: Procrastination.  
“I’ll start writing tomorrow.”  
We have a saying in Ship 30 for 30, and it goes like this: If you fall off the ship, that’s fine, but just make sure you don’t stay swimming for 2 days in a row (because your writing habit will drown and die).  
  
  
#5: Self-confidence.  
How do you build confidence in yourself as a writer?  
You write.  
It’s so simple that it’s complicated.  
  
The reason why writers struggle with self-confidence at the beginning of their journey is because they are still sitting on the dock, waiting, imagining. They haven’t yet confronted the brutal reality that, once they begin, they probably aren’t going to be great at writing. It’s going to take practice. So in order to overcome this fear and START gaining self-confidence, you need to rip the bandaid off and begin. The reframe here is: nobody starts out confident.  
  
Confidence is something you build as you move forward.  
  
#6: Generating ideas.  
A lot of writers have this fear that someone is going to “steal their ideas.”  
But writers who are afraid of other writers stealing their ideas are afraid because they don’t know how to create more ideas. Said differently: they value the ideas they have SO MUCH because they don’t have the skill of creating more ideas on command. Well, that’s why I created an Endless Idea Generator for writers to use anytime they feel stuck. (I still use the Endless Idea Generator every single day in my own writing. Why? Because it works.)  
  
#7: Impostor syndrome.  
The reason writers experience Imposter Syndrome is because we are taught that writing is all about “fitting in” where readers already are.  
It’s about becoming a “better” writer than the next person — which is what leads to the feeling of being an imposter.  
I don’t believe this is a healthy path forward for writers.

How to achieve more in a day than most ppl in week  
  
Prioritize sleep  
Find a calming activity to do just before bed. Anything that puts you in a serene state of mind will work. Reading a book while lying on my stomach is my go-to.  
create night ritual with pleasurable task  
2 Ruthlessly prioritize. Create 2 task buckets  
I like to call these the primary and secondary buckets — the former 3 are to be achieved at any cost while the latter ones only if the primary ones are done.  
  
3 Chisel down to finsest level of details  
  
4 Cultivate task specific rituals  
   
5 make distractions invisible  
  
6 Alternate short bursts of and long leisure  
A 5-hour writing session after which I scrapped everything I wrote after the 2-hour mark taught me this the hard way. This is where leisure comes in.  
If sleep is the first thing toxic productivists hate, leisure is the second one. And funnily, both are instrumental to productivity. Leisure replenishes everything deep work consumes— focus, mood, motivation, and mental energy.  
  
How writing affects your brain  
Writing is a stimulating yet strenuous activity for the brain, especially when you are working on a first draft. If you’ve ever felt muscle pain and exhaustion after physical activity, you know what I mean.  
many parts of the brain become engaged. The more you write, the more a brain responds by establishing new neural connections within these regions.  
  
here are the benefits you can expect to get from writing.  
You develop organizational skills — from crafting and sequencing your thoughts and ideas  
You boost your reasoning and problem-solving skills  
You integrate a wide range of vocabulary words and grow your word bank  
  
  
How you can train your brain to write  
Freewriting  
For starters, one of the ways you can do this is by freewriting every day for 5–10 minutes. This method works best if you don’t have a solid topic idea in mind and just want to write whatever comes to mind. You tap into your imagination and let it follow its course.  
  
Reading  
To get a head start, start reading the content you like the most. Doing that will activate your brain and help fill your brain with ideas. Reading also allows you to build your vocabulary and learn the art of writing.

I don’t believe this is a healthy path forward for writers.  
A better way of thinking about your path forward as a writer is figuring out how you can be DIFFERENT, not “better” than the competition. After all, how can you be an imposter if you created something completely different for yourself?  
  
#8: Writing consistently.  
The vast majority of writers & creators don’t have a talent problem.  
They have a consistency problem.  
It’s a cliché because it’s true.  
  
#9: Choosing a platform.  
Where’s the best place to write online?  
The honest answer to this question is: anywhere except your own blog. Instead, you want to write in social publishing environments like Twitter, Quora, Medium. Or, if you want to set up a Social Blog, I encourage you to use Typeshare (so you get the benefits of both a personal blog and social distribution).  
If you want more insight into why starting with a blog is NOT the best place to begin writing online, grab a copy of The Art & Business of Online Writing.  
  
#10: Finding time to write.  
And of course, one of the biggest reasons writers don’t write is because they “don’t have time.”  
Well, here’s the thing — not just about writing, but about anything in life: when it comes to making progress on things that are important to us, you don’t “find” time. You make time. These hours are your Sacred Hours, and it’s your responsibility as a writer to make time where you are a) most likely to be productive, but b) least likely to be disturbed by the outside world.  
Your Sacred Hours might be early in the morning, at lunch, or at night.  
But it’s on you to pinpoint them, and then protect them.

And the reason these problems are so common is because so many writers are STUCK in the legacy world, still following “the old rules” of writing and believing they need to become some magical genius before they’re allowed to write and publish anything in the world.  
When that’s simply just not true.  
Here are the problems that hold writers back the most, along with some mental shifts to help you overcome them:  
#1: Distractions.  
Writers love distractions.  
It’s the easiest way to postpone doing the thing that needs to be done, which is sit down and write. “I need to do my laundry” is a common one.  
So is, “I need to give my friend a call” or “I’ve been working so hard lately, I could use a night watching Netflix.” But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  
#2: Over-editing.  
Writers love switching out adjectives, debating, “Should I say ‘amazing’ or ‘astounding?’”  
But the truth is, these types of edits don’t matter.  
And here’s why.  
One of the first big principles we teach in Ship 30 for 30 is that, in your first year of writing online, you shouldn’t worry about editing at all (and we’ll explain why further in this guide).  
Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.  
But before you figure that out, editing is a waste of time.  
#3: Perfectionism.  
Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
“It’s not ready yet.”  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
One of the biggest obstacles writers need to overcome early on is realizing that “perfect” is an unreasonable milestone. More importantly, aiming for “perfect” slows you down — so much so, that other writers who aren’t aiming for perfect end up zooming right by you.  
A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”  
Who cares if you write and publish something that doesn’t get a lot of traction? In everything you write, you are learning. And the more you learn, the faster you will grow, the better you’ll get, and so on. Aiming for perfection isn’t productive.  
#4: Procrastination.  
“I’ll start writing tomorrow.”  
We have a saying in Ship 30 for 30, and it goes like this: If you fall off the ship, that’s fine, but just make sure you don’t stay swimming for 2 days in a row (because your writing habit will drown and die).  
  
  
#5: Self-confidence.  
How do you build confidence in yourself as a writer?  
You write.  
It’s so simple that it’s complicated.  
  
The reason why writers struggle with self-confidence at the beginning of their journey is because they are still sitting on the dock, waiting, imagining. They haven’t yet confronted the brutal reality that, once they begin, they probably aren’t going to be great at writing. It’s going to take practice. So in order to overcome this fear and START gaining self-confidence, you need to rip the bandaid off and begin. The reframe here is: nobody starts out confident.  
  
Confidence is something you build as you move forward.  
  
#6: Generating ideas.  
A lot of writers have this fear that someone is going to “steal their ideas.”  
But writers who are afraid of other writers stealing their ideas are afraid because they don’t know how to create more ideas. Said differently: they value the ideas they have SO MUCH because they don’t have the skill of creating more ideas on command. Well, that’s why I created an Endless Idea Generator for writers to use anytime they feel stuck. (I still use the Endless Idea Generator every single day in my own writing. Why? Because it works.)  
  
#7: Impostor syndrome.  
The reason writers experience Imposter Syndrome is because we are taught that writing is all about “fitting in” where readers already are.  
It’s about becoming a “better” writer than the next person — which is what leads to the feeling of being an imposter.  
I don’t believe this is a healthy path forward for writers.

How to achieve more in a day than most ppl in week  
  
Prioritize sleep  
Find a calming activity to do just before bed. Anything that puts you in a serene state of mind will work. Reading a book while lying on my stomach is my go-to.  
create night ritual with pleasurable task  
2 Ruthlessly prioritize. Create 2 task buckets  
I like to call these the primary and secondary buckets — the former 3 are to be achieved at any cost while the latter ones only if the primary ones are done.  
  
3 Chisel down to finsest level of details  
  
4 Cultivate task specific rituals  
   
5 make distractions invisible  
  
6 Alternate short bursts of and long leisure  
A 5-hour writing session after which I scrapped everything I wrote after the 2-hour mark taught me this the hard way. This is where leisure comes in.  
If sleep is the first thing toxic productivists hate, leisure is the second one. And funnily, both are instrumental to productivity. Leisure replenishes everything deep work consumes— focus, mood, motivation, and mental energy.  
  
How writing affects your brain  
Writing is a stimulating yet strenuous activity for the brain, especially when you are working on a first draft. If you’ve ever felt muscle pain and exhaustion after physical activity, you know what I mean.  
many parts of the brain become engaged. The more you write, the more a brain responds by establishing new neural connections within these regions.  
  
here are the benefits you can expect to get from writing.  
You develop organizational skills — from crafting and sequencing your thoughts and ideas  
You boost your reasoning and problem-solving skills  
You integrate a wide range of vocabulary words and grow your word bank  
  
  
How you can train your brain to write  
Freewriting  
For starters, one of the ways you can do this is by freewriting every day for 5–10 minutes. This method works best if you don’t have a solid topic idea in mind and just want to write whatever comes to mind. You tap into your imagination and let it follow its course.  
  
Reading  
To get a head start, start reading the content you like the most. Doing that will activate your brain and help fill your brain with ideas. Reading also allows you to build your vocabulary and learn the art of writing.

All Beginner Writers Face The Same 10 Problems (Here’s How To Fix Them)

Maybe you want to start writing online, but aren’t sure which of your ideas are “good enough” to publish.  
Or maybe you’ve been working on a few drafts that are saved somewhere on your computer, but you’ve been hesitant to share them.  
I’m here to tell you, you’re not alone.  
  
All beginner writers face the same 10 overarching problems.  
And the reason these problems are so common is because so many writers are STUCK in the legacy world, still following “the old rules” of writing and believing they need to become some magical genius before they’re allowed to write and publish anything in the world.

A better way of thinking about your path forward as a writer is figuring out how you can be DIFFERENT, not “better” than the competition. After all, how can you be an imposter if you created something completely different for yourself?  
  
#8: Writing consistently.  
The vast majority of writers & creators don’t have a talent problem.  
They have a consistency problem.  
It’s a cliché because it’s true.  
  
#9: Choosing a platform.  
Where’s the best place to write online?  
The honest answer to this question is: anywhere except your own blog. Instead, you want to write in social publishing environments like Twitter, Quora, Medium. Or, if you want to set up a Social Blog, I encourage you to use Typeshare (so you get the benefits of both a personal blog and social distribution).  
If you want more insight into why starting with a blog is NOT the best place to begin writing online, grab a copy of The Art & Business of Online Writing.  
  
#10: Finding time to write.  
And of course, one of the biggest reasons writers don’t write is because they “don’t have time.”  
Well, here’s the thing — not just about writing, but about anything in life: when it comes to making progress on things that are important to us, you don’t “find” time. You make time. These hours are your Sacred Hours, and it’s your responsibility as a writer to make time where you are a) most likely to be productive, but b) least likely to be disturbed by the outside world.  
Your Sacred Hours might be early in the morning, at lunch, or at night.  
But it’s on you to pinpoint them, and then protect them.

One of the first big principles we teach in Ship 30 for 30 is that, in your first year of writing online, you shouldn’t worry about editing at all (and we’ll explain why further in this guide).  
Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.  
But before you figure that out, editing is a waste of time.  
#3: Perfectionism.  
Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
“It’s not ready yet.”  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
One of the biggest obstacles writers need to overcome early on is realizing that “perfect” is an unreasonable milestone. More importantly, aiming for “perfect” slows you down — so much so, that other writers who aren’t aiming for perfect end up zooming right by you.  
A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”  
Who cares if you write and publish something that doesn’t get a lot of traction? In everything you write, you are learning. And the more you learn, the faster you will grow, the better you’ll get, and so on. Aiming for perfection isn’t productive.  
#4: Procrastination.  
“I’ll start writing tomorrow.”  
We have a saying in Ship 30 for 30, and it goes like this: If you fall off the ship, that’s fine, but just make sure you don’t stay swimming for 2 days in a row (because your writing habit will drown and die).  
  
  
#5: Self-confidence.  
How do you build confidence in yourself as a writer?  
You write.  
It’s so simple that it’s complicated.  
  
The reason why writers struggle with self-confidence at the beginning of their journey is because they are still sitting on the dock, waiting, imagining. They haven’t yet confronted the brutal reality that, once they begin, they probably aren’t going to be great at writing. It’s going to take practice. So in order to overcome this fear and START gaining self-confidence, you need to rip the bandaid off and begin. The reframe here is: nobody starts out confident.  
  
Confidence is something you build as you move forward.  
  
#6: Generating ideas.  
A lot of writers have this fear that someone is going to “steal their ideas.”  
But writers who are afraid of other writers stealing their ideas are afraid because they don’t know how to create more ideas. Said differently: they value the ideas they have SO MUCH because they don’t have the skill of creating more ideas on command. Well, that’s why I created an Endless Idea Generator for writers to use anytime they feel stuck. (I still use the Endless Idea Generator every single day in my own writing. Why? Because it works.)  
  
#7: Impostor syndrome.  
The reason writers experience Imposter Syndrome is because we are taught that writing is all about “fitting in” where readers already are.  
It’s about becoming a “better” writer than the next person — which is what leads to the feeling of being an imposter.  
I don’t believe this is a healthy path forward for writers.  
A better way of thinking about your path forward as a writer is figuring out how you can be DIFFERENT, not “better” than the competition. After all, how can you be an imposter if you created something completely different for yourself?  
  
#8: Writing consistently.  
The vast majority of writers & creators don’t have a talent problem.  
They have a consistency problem.  
It’s a cliché because it’s true.  
  
#9: Choosing a platform.  
Where’s the best place to write online?  
The honest answer to this question is: anywhere except your own blog. Instead, you want to write in social publishing environments like Twitter, Quora, Medium. Or, if you want to set up a Social Blog, I encourage you to use Typeshare (so you get the benefits of both a personal blog and social distribution).  
If you want more insight into why starting with a blog is NOT the best place to begin writing online, grab a copy of The Art & Business of Online Writing.

How to achieve more in a day than most ppl in week  
  
Prioritize sleep  
Find a calming activity to do just before bed. Anything that puts you in a serene state of mind will work. Reading a book while lying on my stomach is my go-to.  
create night ritual with pleasurable task  
2 Ruthlessly prioritize. Create 2 task buckets  
I like to call these the primary and secondary buckets — the former 3 are to be achieved at any cost while the latter ones only if the primary ones are done.  
  
3 Chisel down to finsest level of details  
  
4 Cultivate task specific rituals  
   
5 make distractions invisible  
  
6 Alternate short bursts of and long leisure  
A 5-hour writing session after which I scrapped everything I wrote after the 2-hour mark taught me this the hard way. This is where leisure comes in.  
If sleep is the first thing toxic productivists hate, leisure is the second one. And funnily, both are instrumental to productivity. Leisure replenishes everything deep work consumes— focus, mood, motivation, and mental energy.  
  
How writing affects your brain  
Writing is a stimulating yet strenuous activity for the brain, especially when you are working on a first draft. If you’ve ever felt muscle pain and exhaustion after physical activity, you know what I mean.  
many parts of the brain become engaged. The more you write, the more a brain responds by establishing new neural connections within these regions.  
  
here are the benefits you can expect to get from writing.  
You develop organizational skills — from crafting and sequencing your thoughts and ideas  
You boost your reasoning and problem-solving skills  
You integrate a wide range of vocabulary words and grow your word bank  
  
  
How you can train your brain to write  
Freewriting  
For starters, one of the ways you can do this is by freewriting every day for 5–10 minutes. This method works best if you don’t have a solid topic idea in mind and just want to write whatever comes to mind. You tap into your imagination and let it follow its course.  
  
Reading  
To get a head start, start reading the content you like the most. Doing that will activate your brain and help fill your brain with ideas. Reading also allows you to build your vocabulary and learn the art of writing.  
  
All beginner writers face 10 probs. How to fix  
#1: Distractions.  
But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  
  
#2: Over-editing.  
Writers love switching out adjectives, debating, “Should I say ‘amazing’ or ‘astounding?’”

All Beginner Writers Face The Same 10 Problems (Here’s How To Fix Them)  
By ship30for30.com6 min  
View Original  
  
Maybe you want to start writing online, but aren’t sure which of your ideas are “good enough” to publish.  
Or maybe you’ve been working on a few drafts that are saved somewhere on your computer, but you’ve been hesitant to share them.  
I’m here to tell you, you’re not alone.  
  
All beginner writers face the same 10 overarching problems.  
And the reason these problems are so common is because so many writers are STUCK in the legacy world, still following “the old rules” of writing and believing they need to become some magical genius before they’re allowed to write and publish anything in the world.  
When that’s simply just not true.  
Here are the problems that hold writers back the most, along with some mental shifts to help you overcome them:  
#1: Distractions.  
Writers love distractions.  
It’s the easiest way to postpone doing the thing that needs to be done, which is sit down and write. “I need to do my laundry” is a common one.  
So is, “I need to give my friend a call” or “I’ve been working so hard lately, I could use a night watching Netflix.” But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  
#2: Over-editing.

#10: Finding time to write.  
And of course, one of the biggest reasons writers don’t write is because they “don’t have time.”  
Well, here’s the thing — not just about writing, but about anything in life: when it comes to making progress on things that are important to us, you don’t “find” time. You make time. These hours are your Sacred Hours, and it’s your responsibility as a writer to make time where you are a) most likely to be productive, but b) least likely to be disturbed by the outside world.  
Your Sacred Hours might be early in the morning, at lunch, or at night.  
But it’s on you to pinpoint them, and then protect them.

So is, “I need to give my friend a call” or “I’ve been working so hard lately, I could use a night watching Netflix.” But a small, powerful reframe here is actually seeing the distractions in your life as potential material and things to write about. Instead of getting frustrated by having human responsibilities, impulses, and friends who want to see you, write about them!  
#2: Over-editing.  
Writers love switching out adjectives, debating, “Should I say ‘amazing’ or ‘astounding?’”  
But the truth is, these types of edits don’t matter.  
And here’s why.  
One of the first big principles we teach in Ship 30 for 30 is that, in your first year of writing online, you shouldn’t worry about editing at all (and we’ll explain why further in this guide).  
Instead, you should focus on getting your IDEAS out into the world. Forget the adjectives. Forget the grammar. Just focus on validating whether you are headed in the right direction. Then, once you get a sense for what ideas are intriguing to readers, THEN start refining your writing.  
But before you figure that out, editing is a waste of time.  
#3: Perfectionism.  
Ah, a writer’s favorite excuse.  
“It’s not ready yet.”  
OK, when will it be ready, then?  
One of the biggest obstacles writers need to overcome early on is realizing that “perfect” is an unreasonable milestone. More importantly, aiming for “perfect” slows you down — so much so, that other writers who aren’t aiming for perfect end up zooming right by you.  
A reframe I find helpful here is to allow yourself to create “junk.”  
Who cares if you write and publish something that doesn’t get a lot of traction? In everything you write, you are learning. And the more you learn, the faster you will grow, the better you’ll get, and so on. Aiming for perfection isn’t productive.  
#4: Procrastination.  
“I’ll start writing tomorrow.”  
We have a saying in Ship 30 for 30, and it goes like this: If you fall off the ship, that’s fine, but just make sure you don’t stay swimming for 2 days in a row (because your writing habit will drown and die).  
  
  
#5: Self-confidence.  
How do you build confidence in yourself as a writer?  
You write.  
It’s so simple that it’s complicated.  
  
The reason why writers struggle with self-confidence at the beginning of their journey is because they are still sitting on the dock, waiting, imagining. They haven’t yet confronted the brutal reality that, once they begin, they probably aren’t going to be great at writing. It’s going to take practice. So in order to overcome this fear and START gaining self-confidence, you need to rip the bandaid off and begin. The reframe here is: nobody starts out confident.  
  
Confidence is something you build as you move forward.  
  
#6: Generating ideas.  
A lot of writers have this fear that someone is going to “steal their ideas.”  
But writers who are afraid of other writers stealing their ideas are afraid because they don’t know how to create more ideas. Said differently: they value the ideas they have SO MUCH because they don’t have the skill of creating more ideas on command. Well, that’s why I created an Endless Idea Generator for writers to use anytime they feel stuck. (I still use the Endless Idea Generator every single day in my own writing. Why? Because it works.)  
  
#7: Impostor syndrome.  
The reason writers experience Imposter Syndrome is because we are taught that writing is all about “fitting in” where readers already are.  
It’s about becoming a “better” writer than the next person — which is what leads to the feeling of being an imposter.  
I don’t believe this is a healthy path forward for writers.  
A better way of thinking about your path forward as a writer is figuring out how you can be DIFFERENT, not “better” than the competition. After all, how can you be an imposter if you created something completely different for yourself?  
  
#8: Writing consistently.  
The vast majority of writers & creators don’t have a talent problem.  
They have a consistency problem.  
It’s a cliché because it’s true.  
  
#9: Choosing a platform.  
Where’s the best place to write online?  
The honest answer to this question is: anywhere except your own blog. Instead, you want to write in social publishing environments like Twitter, Quora, Medium. Or, if you want to set up a Social Blog, I encourage you to use Typeshare (so you get the benefits of both a personal blog and social distribution).  
If you want more insight into why starting with a blog is NOT the best place to begin writing online, grab a copy of The Art & Business of Online Writing.  
  
#10: Finding time to write.  
And of course, one of the biggest reasons writers don’t write is because they “don’t have time.”  
Well, here’s the thing — not just about writing, but about anything in life: when it comes to making progress on things that are important to us, you don’t “find” time. You make time. These hours are your Sacred Hours, and it’s your responsibility as a writer to make time where you are a) most likely to be productive, but b) least likely to be disturbed by the outside world.  
Your Sacred Hours might be early in the morning, at lunch, or at night.  
But it’s on you to pinpoint them, and then protect them.

How to achieve more in a day than most ppl in week  
  
Prioritize sleep  
Find a calming activity to do just before bed. Anything that puts you in a serene state of mind will work. Reading a book while lying on my stomach is my go-to.  
create night ritual with pleasurable task  
2 Ruthlessly prioritize. Create 2 task buckets  
I like to call these the primary and secondary buckets — the former 3 are to be achieved at any cost while the latter ones only if the primary ones are done.  
  
3 Chisel down to finsest level of details  
  
4 Cultivate task specific rituals  
   
5 make distractions invisible  
  
6 Alternate short bursts of and long leisure  
A 5-hour writing session after which I scrapped everything I wrote after the 2-hour mark taught me this the hard way. This is where leisure comes in.  
If sleep is the first thing toxic productivists hate, leisure is the second one. And funnily, both are instrumental to productivity. Leisure replenishes everything deep work consumes— focus, mood, motivation, and mental energy.  
  
How writing affects your brain  
Writing is a stimulating yet strenuous activity for the brain, especially when you are working on a first draft. If you’ve ever felt muscle pain and exhaustion after physical activity, you know what I mean.  
many parts of the brain become engaged. The more you write, the more a brain responds by establishing new neural connections within these regions.  
  
here are the benefits you can expect to get from writing.  
You develop organizational skills — from crafting and sequencing your thoughts and ideas  
You boost your reasoning and problem-solving skills  
You integrate a wide range of vocabulary words and grow your word bank  
  
  
How you can train your brain to write  
Freewriting  
For starters, one of the ways you can do this is by freewriting every day for 5–10 minutes. This method works best if you don’t have a solid topic idea in mind and just want to write whatever comes to mind. You tap into your imagination and let it follow its course.  
  
Reading  
To get a head start, start reading the content you like the most. Doing that will activate your brain and help fill your brain with ideas. Reading also allows you to build your vocabulary and learn the art of writing.

All Beginner Writers Face The Same 10 Problems (Here’s How To Fix Them)  
By ship30for30.com6 min  
View Original  
  
Maybe you want to start writing online, but aren’t sure which of your ideas are “good enough” to publish.  
Or maybe you’ve been working on a few drafts that are saved somewhere on your computer, but you’ve been hesitant to share them.  
I’m here to tell you, you’re not alone.  
  
All beginner writers face the same 10 overarching problems.  
And the reason these problems are so common is because so many writers are STUCK in the legacy world, still following “the old rules” of writing and believing they need to become some magical genius before they’re allowed to write and publish anything in the world.  
When that’s simply just not true.  
Here are the problems that hold writers back the most, along with some mental shifts to help you overcome them:

## How to become so disc it looks liek you have superpower

1 Great power lies in doing the absurd  
Here’s something that will happen once you start being consistently disciplined:  
**People will think you’re weird.** They might even attack you for it.  
You’ll get confused looks and raised eyebrows when you tell people what you do.  
  
  
ut it also elicits jealousy and resentment. In a way, your ascent highlights their stagnation. Naysayers and their doubts say more about them than about you.  
  
As best-selling author Grant Cardone once wrote:  

> _“Take into account that you have been educated with restrictions. Be aware of this so that you don’t underestimate the possibilities.”_

**If you want what you’ve never had, you’ll have to do stuff you’ve never done.**  
  
  
  
 How can you use your brain when you’re so tired from the day?  
The answer is simple: **take yourself out of the equation.**  
Make a commitment to perform, and you will.  
  
Here’s the thing: “you” are tired. “You” will be exhausted, sleepy, and hangry (that’s hungry+angry) when you get home after a long day. The odds of consistently doing what you need to do in this state will be slim.  
  
  
When you design an environment to produce success, you remove all the energy-wasting dilemmas of “Should I go to the gym, or stay home?” You just go to the gym, because that’s what you do.  
  

### grow an upper class mindset

Extraordinary people don’t “manage time.” They _make_ time. They don’t “manage money” or “save money,” they _make_ money. They appear to have superpowers, making deals and accomplishing goals most people would tell you are impossible.  

### Embracing shadow self

Why, you ask, would anyone wish himself to fail? Because we are human and just like an iceberg, we are not aware of a lot of things going on below the surface.  
Carl Jung brought us the concept of ‘The Shadow’. The shadow is all the parts of ourselves that we hate and so consciously or unconsciously hide. It’s all the aspects of ourselves that our parents, peers, and society didn’t approve of, so we rejected them out of fear, shame, and ignorance.  
  
After adolescence, we develop an idealized sense of self. What doesn’t fit this self goes to our shadow self. However, this shadow follows us around, behind us and is forever attached to us. We can’t outrun it or lose it as it is part of us.  
  
  
He wanted their love and approval so much that he started making up stories to appease them. Saying he came first in a school run or that his teacher had said he was the best student in the class.  
The more he lied and created stories that he was always the hero, the more his parents loved him. The more he pushed his insecurities back into his consciousness, the more he forgot them.  
  
However, no shadow can exist without its light. If you want to remove the shadow, you must remove the light that shines in you. We can’t have light without the dark. We can’t have success without contemplating failure. How can we value what we have if we can’t also value the lack of it?  
  
  
Jung believed that rather than extinguishing our shadows and thus our light, we must integrate it into ourselves. We must embrace our darkness — fears, desires and shame — the very things we are most afraid of facing. We must own our shadow, accept its ugliness but respectfully disagree with its worst aspects.  
  
Debbie Ford, an expert on shadow work and famous author, said in her book, _The Dark Side of the Light Chasers_, that: “there is a “light shadow,” a place where we have buried our power, our competence, and our authenticity. The dark parts of our psyches are only dark when they are stuffed away and hidden. When we bring them into the light of our consciousness and find their sacred gifts, they transform us. Then we are free.”  
  
Most of us have spent most of our lives denying our shadow self. Instead of chasing the light, hoping that it would extinguish the darkness, we should bring forth our shadow and face it.  
  
Just imagine how my friend would be like if he could integrate his wonderful prominent personality with having enough self-love to feel like he deserved one business deal now and then  

1.  Start with a visionary founder who is obsessed with product design, who is an engineer by trade, and who is a natural salesman. Most companies don’t even get past this first step. Hopin did because we have Johnny.
2.  Hire _just_ engineers as contractors and one other generalist entrepreneur who can write, sell, and help customers succeed.
3.  Build a great product with a viral growth loop built into it.
4.  Work closely with key ICPs to shape your product roadmap. Remember that the market you start out serving may not be the market you end up dominating in. With Hopin, we began with solopreneurs, boutique agencies, and influencers but accelerated upmarket quickly.
5.  Hire more engineers.
6.  Sign your first annual contracts to anchor desirable customers.
7.  Begin talking with investors about a pre-seed or seed round.
8.  Hire a customer success person, a support person, and a salesperson with a proclivity for ops.
9.  Launch in early access. Build a waitlist, letting in customers slowly. Use a lean marketing tech stack like Hubspot CRM, Zapier, Stripe, and Typeform. This waitlist is your community. StreamYard has an amazing blueprint for building a community of raving fans.
10.  Get customer permissions to use recognizable logos and publish select case studies with good logos and/or numbers. These case studies reflect back to the market the type of customers you are built for (i.e., enterprise vs. SMBs)
11.  Hire a PR firm to build buzz.
12.  Hire more engineers. Begin to focus on organization, product management, and start to work with GTM on a customer-friendly product release process. Hire a product marketer. ARWAG. Always Release With A GIF.
13.  Scale the sales team to do demos and close more deals. Bring in a business operations (biz ops) leader.
14.  Scale the success and support teams. The better the product, the smaller these should be. The more complicated the product, the larger these teams need to be. Also, in hyperscaling, support content becomes outdated fast so build in a process for keeping it fresh and up to date.
15.  You should be working with 5+ agencies by now to outsource most of your marketing efforts (brand, creative, paid ads, SEO, content, events, and PR). Write clear briefs. Bring vendors into Slack. Be quick to move on from agencies who are not good fits.
16.  Experiment with pricing. Where do you want to be in the market compared to competitors? Ideally, you can offer a free version that has your branding watermarked somewhere (feed the viral growth loop). Also, always be working on the next plan up.
17.  Leverage community feedback (a Facebook group is fine) and user surveys (HotJar is great) for identifying the must-have features that will move customers up to the next plan.
18.  Product/market fit is when growth numbers are up and to the right WoW for a dependable amount of time. The waitlist should be swelling. Customers should be regularly writing happy reviews, if not, incentivize them, getting you to the top of the review sites where your customers are researching products.
19.  Couple the launch with your Series A announcement, directing traffic to your first customer event where you announce a flagship feature.

  
My best skill is probably my willingness to take action even if it means I might be wrong. So much of the early days in a startup is experimentation and experiments often fail. One of my life quotes is “teachers teach, coaches coach, entrepreneurs fail.  
  
Something I learned from Johnny in the early days about B2b software sales was this idea of “roadmap marketing.” At Hopin, if Johnny was on the call, we never lost the sale. The reason was, if a prospect on a demo asked about a feature we didn’t have, Johnny would ask when their event was. They’d answer with a date. Johnny would think it over for a moment. Then answer, “Yes, we’ll have it by then.” He knew we could build it by then, even if it meant he himself jumped into the code. If they signed, that date became the new deadline to ship the requested feature. And we always did. The takeaway is don’t be afraid to sell a feature that isn’t quite in production yet. Sell the roadmap. Not only does it light a fire under the whole company to delight a client by delivering by a deadline, it also is highly probable that by the time it’s shipped you’ll have just gotten through legal and procurement.  
  
  
Think in deliverables  
This is simply a startup-y way of restating Steven Covey’s principle “Begin with the end in mind.”  

# How to be strategic

The most common reason why someone gets hired over is because they weren’t “strategic” enough. I’m guilty of this. Both on the receiving end and the giving end.  
  
Being strategic is a direct indication of how big you’re thinking. Fast-moving companies need articulate big thinkers. Thinking big means seeing the big picture, setting the right goals, and envisioning not only the desired state of the future but also the KPIs, systems and processes and team it takes to achieve it. Thinking small looks like just a list of KPIs. It looks like achievable and predictable goals. It looks like a document or deck that is unclear, unstructured, and hard to follow.  
  
Your experience really comes through when it’s questioned — does it stand up to scrutinizing inquiries? Is it connected to a vision anchored in reality, or is it just a pretty looking document with well-written concepts?  
  
The sign of a good strategic thinker is not that they have just articulated the problems, goals, plans, people, and metrics of the next quarter. That’s table stakes. They also have the story, the narrative, that they’re creating. They can confidently describe what the future looks like. And it often looks like a version of something they’ve experienced in the past or from history or from another player in the market that they’ve studied. They have a model they’re building off of.  
  
Common advice says that opportunities like this come from networking and saying the right thing to the right people at the right time, but to put it into more of a concrete takeaway, I’d put it like this:  
**Always have a project that puts you out there.** A project that puts you out there could be anything — an app, a website, a blog, a product, a consulting service, a book, a side project, a hobby, a community, an event. As long as you’re consistently working on it and therefore being seen and meeting new people, it’s just a matter of time before you get lucky.

# How to stop bein afraid of looking stupid

**Fear of looking stupid** is the #1 killer of dreams.  
  
Failure isn’t something to be avoided — it’s something to be prized.  
Failure is direct feedback. Failure is knowledge. Failure is progress.  
  
In his autobiography, Bryan Cranston (Walter White from _Breaking Bad_) described his early acting days, and how stressed/anxious he was at auditions. He was always focused on “getting” the role. But his fear and anxiety always shone through his performance, and after many years, he was still a below-average actor.  
Finally, he decided to focus on the process — “giving” a performance, “doing” a job. He stopped worrying about failing, or getting the role, or what the casting directors thought; he just focused on giving a great performance.  
  
Years ago, I was just starting to see some success in writing. A famous blogger — one of my role models — began publicly making fun of me, accusing me of copying his style and making jokes about me to his fans. He said people like me “would be gone in 6 months.”  
  
I never forgot that. I used it as fuel, motivation to show the world that no, I wasn’t going away — I was the real deal, and I was here to stay.

# 7 Lessons from Mentor

 Srini Rao   
When I met my most influential mentor Greg Hartle, he had 150 followers on Twitter and he was six weeks into a project called “$10 and a Laptop” with a simple premise and three goals.  

1.  **Visit all 50 states**
2.  **Work one on one with 500 people**
3.  **Start a business in an industry he knew nothing about**

  
The caveat: The only resources he could use to achieve his goals were the ten dollars and the laptop.  
  
We all have problems, issues, challenges, and obstacles to overcome. But the difference between people who turn obstacles into opportunities and those who do not is that the former do not let their circumstances become their identity.  

-   **Having no money left is a circumstance. Being poor is an identity.**
-   **Having your heart broken is a circumstance. Not being lovable is an identity.**

  
Getting everything you want will not make you as happy as you think. But there’s another side to the coin. Something about getting what you want is going to suck.  
  
People assume that success makes their problems go away. But the opposite is true. It creates new problems.  
  

## 4. You Can Not Go Further Than What You Are Attached To

  
The first tree represents a job you quit or a relationship that ended. The second represents all the possibilities for your future. As long as you are hanging on to one branch of the first tree, you will never be able to reach the other. You have to let go of who you were in the past to become the person you want to be in the future.  
  
  
Confirmation bias could lead you to believe that you will be just as successful as someone else if you follow their advice. Just because something works for one person does not mean it will work for you. If you think it’s going to work, you are overlooking the [glaringly obvious variable that throws any formula for success out the window.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/blatantly-obvious-variable-throws-off-every-success-formula/)  

# 6. Momentum Is the Lifeblood of a Startup or Creative Endeavor

  
Greg describes this virtuous cycle as a “momentum window.” If you play your cards right, you will never go back to the same level. But if you rest on your laurels, you’ll lose your momentum.  
  
Success makes us overconfident. “The next time you are tempted to bask in the glory of your success and admire the scoreboard, stop and take a break. Ask yourself what went wrong with that success. What role did luck, opportunity, and privilege play?” says Ozan Varol in his book ﻿Think Like a Rocket Scientist﻿ .  
  
  
While these events can be a catalyst for your growth, they can also become a crutch. Anyone who has ever attended one knows about the “high” you feel at the end. But when you get on the plane to go home and return to your normal environment, that high wears off.  
  
  
“What we do is we go to the safe places. The safe places are the ones at the motivational events. The safe places are the places where everyone else is pretending to be happy. The safe places are the internet and the television and the happy commercials and all the things that allow us to avoid reality. And that’s the place we tend to spend most of our time because it’s very vulnerable and hard and exposing in the recesses of our own minds, and that’s a very lonely place to be”  
  
  
**Often escapism is disguised as personal growth. But no matter where you go, your problems, issues and challenges come with you.**
