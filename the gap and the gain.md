“Your future growth and progress are now based in your understanding about the difference between the two ways in which you can measure yourself: against an ideal, which puts you in what I call ‘the GAP,’ and against your starting point, which puts you in ‘the GAIN,’ appreciating all that you’ve accomplished.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“High achievers are particularly prone to being in the GAP. For instance, research shows that CEOs are twice as likely to have depression than the general public.4 Entrepreneurs are prone to substance abuse, as well as depression and suicide.5 Even after some massive victory, their mind quickly goes to the next unreached achievement. Although this can lead to a great deal of external success, the problem remains unresolved internally. Many—if not most—high achievers remain unhappy, and their unhappiness grows deeper and deeper with each external accomplishment.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“That is, if they stay in the GAP.
Thomas Jefferson was, of course, a very inspiring and significant person to American’s history. But the fact remains: Jefferson was in the GAP.
And that’s why he never “found” the happiness he was pursuing.
Unfortunately, Jefferson’s GAP-thinking has become pervasive throughout Western ideology and thinking.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Edward couldn’t escape the GAP.
Edward couldn’t appreciate his GAINS.
He was always trying to bridge a GAP he believed was somewhere in his future.
But the hard fact is that the GAP was always deep inside himself. Eventually, his GAP-thinking became so extreme that he stopped believing in his future entirely”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“The Ideal is where you wish you were.
“You have an ideal in your mind, and you’re measuring yourself against your ideal, rather than against the actual progress you’ve made. This is why you’re unhappy with what you’ve done, and it’s probably why you’re unhappy with everything in your life.
“You’re measuring yourself in the GAP.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks.

“Being in the GAIN means you measure yourself backward, against where you were before.
You measure your own progress. You don’t compare yourself to something external. You don’t measure yourself against your ideals.
We all have countless experiences in life. The question is: Are we truly valuing those experiences? Or are we comparing our experiences to someone else’s?
When you’re in the GAIN, you value your experiences—all of them.
Every experience is viewed as a GAIN.
When you’re in the GAIN, your life is based on your actions ”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“The GAIN is about real “measurables,” not ideals. As performance coach Tim Grover has said, “Winners don’t have a to-do list. They have a ‘done’ list.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“When you’re in the GAIN, you focus on what you’ve actually done. You measure your GAINS and use those GAINS to create more and better GAINS in your future.
Every experience can be transformed into a GAIN.
Being in the GAIN makes you psychologically bulletproof. It doesn’t matter what actually occurs, you can turn the experience into a GAIN.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“When an experience is framed in the GAP, you haven’t learned from it. You haven’t taken ownership of it. Until you actively learn from a GAP-experience, you’re stuck. You won’t be able to move forward until you frame the experience as a GAIN. Until you choose to be grateful for the experience and better off because it happened.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Seth Godin said:
“The rule is simple: the person who fails the most will win. If I fail more than you do, I will win. Because in order to keep failing, you’ve got to be good enough to keep playing.”

“When you ask “Who?” rather than “How?” you free yourself of the burden of needing to do all the work yourself. Instead, you become a leader with vision and a team of capable “Whos” onboard to execute that vision.
This is why I’m the one writing this book and not Dan. He doesn’t write these kinds of books, I do. Yet, he wants these books written. Rather than doing the “How” himself, Dan gets “Whos” to support his increasingly growing vision.

“Let me tell you right now why I wrote this book. When I first learned The GAP and The GAIN, I immediately started using it and it changed my life. It changed how I approach my work, my team, and, most importantly, my family.
As a family, we reference The GAP and The GAIN every single day. My kids even call me out when they catch me going into the GAP (which is more often than I’d like to admit).
I’m about to share something very personal: I hate who I am when I’m in the GAP.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“—I instill an enormous amount of psychological damage in them.
When you’re in the GAP about someone else, all you see is where they’re not measuring up.
You only see their flaws.
You don’t see their GAINS or growth.”

“te he was to even be in this situation at all. He was skating in the Olympics!
By appreciating the GAINS in his life, Jansen was deeply humbled.
He decided this final Olympic event would be an expression of gratitude—a way of saying “thank you” and “goodbye” to the sport, the people, and the experiences he loved so much.
At that point, it didn’t really matter if he won or lost.
He was overcome with joy and gratitude, and he decided to skate with all of the GAINS in his life as his motivation.
Throughout the race, he was beaming a huge smile. He later said it was the happiest he’d ever skated in his whole life.
That run broke a world record and was one of the most emotional wins in Olympic history. Jansen skated near-flawlessly and won the gold.
He won his only Olympic medal in this, his final event. It was the first race he’d ever skated in the GAIN instead of the GAP.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“positive emotions are the starting point of learning, growth, and high performance.3
Positive emotions broaden your options of thinking and acting. As an example, research shows that people in high-stakes situations make the best choices when in a state of gratitude. They can see more clearly the best option before them.4 On the flip side, negative emotions narrow your options, leaving you with only a few rigid ways of handling a given situation.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Dan Jansen tapped into the broaden-and-build phenomenon as he shifted from the GAP to the GAIN. By focusing on the GAINS in his life, he immediately felt better about his life. In fact, he started to feel overwhelmed with joy and gratitude. These positive emotions made him more flexible and creative during his race. He raced with joy and he raced better than he ever had before.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“While in the GAP and thinking about the races he should have won but didn’t, Jansen was unwittingly killing his own confidence levels, which would have negatively impacted his final performance.
However, by focusing on the GAINS in his life, and by looking back on everything he’d achieved, his confidence levels immediately elevated. That confidence enabled him to believe even deeper that he could win and deepened his focus and drive during that gold medal victory.”

“Needing anything outside of yourself is a form of being in the GAP.
When you’re in the GAP, your happiness is tied to something outside of yourself, a moving and unreachable target.”

“Throughout this book, there will be several exercises and journal prompts to help you get out of the GAP and into the GAIN. Start by grabbing a piece of paper and answering the following questions:
What do you feel you “need” in order to be happy?
Who or what do you measure yourself against?
When is a time in your life where you made something or someone into a “need,” and thus created an unhealthy GAP in your life?”

“Obsessive passion is highly impulsive and fueled by suppressed emotions and unresolved internal conflict. You become obsessed with something to the point of an unhealthy desperation. You believe you need it, and can’t be happy without it.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Harmonious passion, on the other hand, is intrinsically motivated and healthy. When you are harmoniously passionate, you control your passion rather than having it control you. You’re intuitive and thoughtful about what you’re doing, not reactive and irrational. You’re purposeful and goal-directed, not “need”-driven.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“Alright, it’s time for another quick exercise. Pull out your journal and answer the following questions:
Are there any areas in your life where you have obsessive passion? If so, what unresolved internal need are you trying to fill?
What about your life and work do you love?
What is your long game? When you’re playing the long game, you’re doing what you love. You’re not doing something just to get somewhere else.
Do you have a long enough time table to truly slow down and enjoy being here, or are you trying to quickly get “there”?
Look at your life right now—what are all the GAINS you can think of?
How would your priorities change if you were playing the ”

“Freedom from is lack of obstacles—you’re not a slave to someone or something.
Freedom to is the presence of control—you’re your own master.
Freedom from is objective and external—you have objective freedom if you live in a free place. For example, an elephant out in the wild may have more external freedoms than an elephant living in a zoo.
Freedom to is subjective and internal—you have subjective freedom if you feel free.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“tion and thriving is autonomy.5 The more independence and ownership you take for yourself, your circumstances, and your life, the more self-determined you will be.
Being self-determined means that you’ve made yourself the reference point, rather than measuring yourself against something external.
Being self-determined means you’re intrinsically, not extrinsically, motivated. This doesn’t mean you don’t use externals as measurables—but you yourself choose those goals for yourself.
Being self-determined means that you’ve decided what success means to you, and you don’t need anyone else’s permission for what you want for yourself. You don’t need to apologize for what you want.
It means you’re clear on WHY you want what you want.
It means you’re no longer competing with anyone else.
Being in the GAIN leads to self-determination.
Becoming self-determined is very difficult in today’s world.”

“When was a time you went into the GAP because you went from wanting something to believing you needed it?
When was a time you went into the GAP by comparing yourself to someone else?
When was a time you used gratitude to reframe a situation into a GAIN and move forward?

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Start using the GAP and GAIN language in the following ways:
Call yourself out when you catch yourself in the GAP. Immediately look for and vocalize the GAIN.
Tell five people you know and love about The GAP and The GAIN. If you so choose, get them a copy of this book so they can live more in the GAIN themselves.
Give those five people permission to call you out when you’re in the GAP.
Help others see and appreciate their own GAINS more by (1) asking them about their recent progress, and (2) pointing out to them their progress. It can be very humbling and empowering to have someone recognize or point out your progress. Be that person who acknowledges other people’s GAINS.
When you’re in a difficult situation, help yourself and others find the GAIN. Rather than being upset, you could ask, “What is the GAIN in this?” Or “How can we turn this into a GAIN?”

“Let’s take some time to start focusing on the GAINS in your life.
Start by mentally subtracting something important to you. Here are the steps:
Pull out a piece of paper and a pen.
Select one specific thing to mentally subtract: it could be a relationship, an achievement, your health, a possession.
Imagine how your life would be if you never had that one thing, or if it was instantly taken away from you forever.
Picture the impact that would have on you right now.
Think about how losing that one thing would affect your future.
How would it affect others?
Write down how your life would be different.
Now, refocus on the present moment and this one thing in your life that you’ve been focusing on. This one thing is a huge GAIN in your life.
How can you appreciate this GAIN more than you have up to this point?
How can you turn this GAIN into even more GAINS?
How have your thoughts and feelings changed about this one thing by doing this exercise?
How do you feel about your life in general right now?

“As humans learn, we quickly adapt to our “new normal,” even when that new normal is very different from what our life used to be.
Psychologists call this automaticity, and it’s how we go from consciously doing something to being able to do it unconsciously.9
If you’re not recording your GAINS like Jill does for her clients, then you will forget many if not most of your GAINS.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“The Conscious Competence Learning Model, generally attributed to William Howell,10 is a four-stage learning theory that explains the process of automaticity.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“Stage One—Unconscious Incompetence: You don’t know how to do something and don’t even recognize your ignorance.12 At this stage, you deny the relevance of learning a particular skill.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Stage Two—Conscious Incompetence: You don’t know how to do something but can see your ignorance and lack of skills. You now see the value of GAINING knowledge and skills to address your current deficiency and you begin seeking growth”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Stage Three—Conscious Competence: You now know a great deal on the subject and can reliably perform the tasks involved. However, you have to concentrate on the task while doing it.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Stage Four—Unconscious Competence: You’ve practiced and performed the task so much that it’s become second nature. You can now perform this task effortlessly and unconsciously—even while doing or thinking about something else”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., stated, “A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”

“There is one specific hour—the “sweet spot” of your day—that has the biggest impact on both your short-term and long-term success.
What you do during this one hour has effects that far outweigh what you do with the other hours of your day.
It determines how productive and purposeful you are, as well as influences how well your brain functions.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“For most people, the last hour of their day is a GAP-hour, distracted by media or binge-eatin”

“While you’re sleeping, your brain processes everything you experienced that day.
But not everything equally.
This is why top-performing athletes—like Michael Phelps, the most winning Olympian of all time—create visualizations of success just before they go to sleep.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“What you do during the hour before bed sets the tone for the rest of your life.
This is where your deepest habits are formed.
How you end your day doesn’t only determine how well you sleep.
It dictates when you’ll wake up.
It orders how clear and directed you are when you awake.
It decides how committed and sold you are on what you’ll do and who you’ll be the next day.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 

“Staring at your phone right before bed is one of the worst things you can do if you want to live an effective, present, and happy life. It has a negative impact on your identity and mindset.
Your identity is how you see yourself, and it drives your behavior.8,9
But your behavior also influences your identity.10 Psychologists have a term, self-signaling, and it means that you judge yourself based on your behavior.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“In a podcast interview with Tim Ferriss, Josh Waitzkin explains the importance of having a “proactive day architecture vs. a reactive day architecture.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“In the hour before bed, Josh gives himself time to think about the most important question he’s trying to answer or problem he’s trying to solve. He then sleeps on it, and the next morning, “pre-input,” he meditates and journals about the same question or problem he was thinking about the night before.
Research shows that creativity is primed just following sleep, especially after REM-based quality sleep.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“The solution is simple. Start by putting your phone on airplane mode and keeping it away from your body 30 minutes before bed. Ideally 60 minutes before.
Sometime within the hour before going to sleep, pull out your journal.
Research shows that writing down three things you’re grateful for each day increases your happiness.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“When you’re in the GAIN, you’re proactive about your experiences—you look at your experiences and utilize them to become more adaptive and successful in your future.”

“Alex Banayan is a highly flexible person. In his book The Third Door, Alex writes that success is like a nightclub:9
“There’s the First Door: the main entrance, where 99 percent of people wait in line, hoping to get in. The Second Door: the VIP entrance, where the billionaires and celebrities slip through. But what no one tells you is that there is always, always . . . the Third Door. It’s the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, sneak through the kitchen—there’s always a way.”
A fundamental aspect of flexibility is what psychologists call pathways thinking, and it’s the ability to find or create many workable paths to a given outcome.10
The more flexible you are as a person, the more willing you’ll be to try multiple approaches to getting where you want to go.”

Excerpt From: Dr. Benjamin Hardy. “The Gap and the Gain.” iBooks. 


“Looking for a meaning puts you in the GAP because it inevitably leads you to compare your situation with someone else’s, creating feelings of either superiority or inadequacy.
