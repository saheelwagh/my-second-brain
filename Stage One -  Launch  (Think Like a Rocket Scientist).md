This chapter is about how to stop fighting uncertainty and harness  
its power. You’ll learn how our obsession with certainty leads us  
astray and why all progress takes place in uncertain conditions.

We spend far more time and effort on  
trying to control the world,” [[Yuval Noah Harari]] writes, “than on trying

## Importance of Redundancies
Redundancy in aerospace  
refers to a backup created to avoid a single point of failure that can compromise the entire mission

other so that the spacecraft can complete its mission even if an  
engine fails
