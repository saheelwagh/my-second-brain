## Prologue
- [ ] Re read this section for writing refernce

-    Back then, nobody could avoid discomfort. It was a fact of life that one  
couldn’t thrive unless they ventured into the world, facing unknown risks and  
possible death in a quest for a better life.
-    Today, most people are unable to wake up early without an alarm clock,  
and even then, it takes them thirty minutes just to crawl out of bed. Most would  
find it impossible to sleep on the bare floor, with insects crawling over them and  
biting their bodies the entire night. If they experienced just a slight ache, most  
would skip work and complain about how much pain they were in. Most  
wouldn’t be able to fast for an entire day, let alone go without food for five days  
in a row
- we have it easy compared to them
-    Yet, or perhaps because of it, so many people struggle with self-discipline  
today. A great majority of them do nothing to fix that, and the ones who try are  
often met with ridicule. If you belong to the group that is trying to better  
themselves or wanting to do so, the book you’re now reading is for you
-    I wrote 365 Days With Self-Discipline with the intention of creating a daily  
companion to help you embrace self-discipline in your everyday life
-    if a person wants to reach their full potential, he or she can’t avoid  
discomfort.
-    n the following pages, I’ll share with you one thought for each day of a  
year that is devoted to the topic of self-discipline, mental toughness, success, or  
self-improvement in general. The thoughts come from some of the world’s  
brightest minds: successful entrepreneurs, athletes, bestselling authors,  
researchers, performers, bloggers, and more
-    Due to the large number of days in a year, some themes will inevitably  
repeat, but I strove to address each subtopic from different perspectives.

# Week 1 : Living The Hard Way
-    Self-discipline means living your life the hard way: resisting temptations  
and instant gratification, in order to receive bigger and better rewards in the  
future.
-    They seek out and welcome challenges as opportunities to grow.
-       Each  
self-imposed affliction strengthens them, so that fewer and fewer difficulties in  
life overwhelm them
-    Day by day, they immunize themselves against problems,  
precisely because they seek them out
-    When life deals them an unexpected blow,  
they’re ready to handle it because — thanks to living their lives the hard way —  
they’re always ready for hardships.
