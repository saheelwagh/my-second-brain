## Experience of Jake
Months were going in a blur. Inspite of havign a perfect job and a pefect girlfriend.
He strated planning work tasks better. This helped with efficiency yet did not feel more satsifying. Goals were meaningful. SHairng goals helped in creating more happiness but still not enough.  (not immediate enough)
Experiences outside work such as lunch with friends felt the most satisfying. As did activities such as walk, jog and sailing.
At work too meaningful moments were more satisfying than robotic tasks. Things that he could look forward to with eagerness and bigger than to-dos.
Examples of [[ substantial projects ]]:
1. Leading engineers in a day fixing bugs
2. Leading a design workshop

##### Components of meaningful task :
1. Plan for
2. Look forward to
3. Appreciate when done.

Highlights sit in between 
goals ( too far) and tasks (machine like)

You create your reality by deciding what you oay attention to.

## 3 ways to pick a highlight
### What do I want the highlight of the day to be ?

1. What is the most pressing thing I need to get done ?
2. What will bring me the most satisfaction at the end of the day ?
3. What will bring me the most joy at the end of today ?


## Highlight Tactics
 1. Write it down
 2. Groundhog it. ( Do yesterday again)
 3. Stack rank your life
	 1. Make a list of the big things that matter in your life
	 2. Gut
	 3. What will need the most energy ?
4. Batch the little stuff
5. Run a personal sprint
	1. reduce boot up
	2. build up a sense of progress


## Todo vs might do
To-do are reflectrion of other people's demands
Never ending

Set up might do lists for each ongoing area of your life then trasnfer one task to highllgiht every day

## Manufacturing time for your highlight

# Small shifts create big results
Radical changes not needed.
You are already close, just allocate a bit more control.

Do not ask what the world needs.  Ask what makes you feel alive and then do it. For the world needs people who have come alive. - [[Howard Thruman]]
