EXERCISE B: THE PRE-MORTEM
In this exercise you will focus on a challenge that you are currently facing and take it through the pre-
mortem process.
If you’re a business leader, a premortem might focus on a product you’re currently designing. You would assume the
product failed and then work backward to determine the potential reasons.
If you’re a job candidate, a premortem might involve an interview. You would assume you didn’t get the job and generate
as many reasons as possible for the failure.
Take the following steps:
• Write down your challenge.
• In a list, note as many things as you can think of that could go wrong to prevent you from succeeding.
• As you think through what can go wrong, assign percentage probabilities to each potential problem (e.g.,
there’s a 10% chance of a delivery delay).
• Now, for each potential problem, note the actions you could take to prevent it.
