__How to become a better writer ?__
- When assuming the role of a writer :
	- Let the words flow without interruption
	- Don't let the critic interfere or aim to please him
	- Utilize diffused focus and proceed non linerarly
- Complex ideas are hard to transalte into words linearly 
- Wait until end of [[pomodoro]] session or writing [[sprint]] to proof read
- Keep printed outline of the [[content piece ]] visible
	- we need to be aware of what we do not have to bother about writing in that write [[sprint]]
	- Easier to find the right words if mentally freed from the structure of the [[content piece]]
