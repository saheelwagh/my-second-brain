I'm increasingly confident that monday isn't just about [[Monday Blues]]. It seems to be the favorite day of [[Murphy's Law]]. Everything I try goes wrong on mondays.

1. Office closure
2. Dad's arrest and today :
3. Network issues at my regular coworking place.


However, I did not quit as I usually do. Instead I
1. Finally resumed writing
2. Finally got obsidian working.
3. Got started on [[my content plan]] and [[freewriting]]


## Lessons learnt :
1. Need offline buffer [[Developing a new habit ? You may need this lesson from bridge construction]]. Need to pause continuous info stream if you want to build a new structure.
2. Need to have redundancies as described in [[Think Like a Rocket Sceintiest]].
3. Flexible schedule works better than rigid. Which may appear counter intuitive first
4.External circumstances are just an excuse. Your internal resistance will be ever present. 
If the wifi was working, I would be facing the same problems. and worse, would fins an excuse as I had many other activities to keep me busy.
