Yesterday I attended [[Introduction to web 3]] conference by __
It was nice to see familiar faces in person after almost two years. 
From Sourav I learnt that it is possible to work 4 hour shifts. just imagine a lifestyle you can design around that to enable creative freedom.
From Salil and Shrey I learnt that you can make great strides at something if you have access to good guidance and a structured path. There is a great demand for crypto devs as there are only 10k good devs. I can target a well paying job in 6 months ? if I start now. Should I go the solana way or ada way ? as rust and haskell both are good.
From Niket i learnt that if you are a designer with good skills you can be gired easily as they are in very good demand.
From Siddarth I learnt that it is essential to specialize. I think my specialization should be in react + next js space. For learning css it is recommended to copy existing desgins to pixel perfect.
Everybody has their own styke of working and learning. Be flexible but get the work done. 

My niche :  #devplan
1. React + nextjs +  -> get job ready in one month
2. Rust or haskell + blockchain -> june 2022
3. product designer -> dec 2021
4. machine learning and iot -> hobby


WRT previous interactions : it is imp to follow up on tasks or projects that are meaningful to you. Also no point in whoring for anything. Maintain your value. Ask someone personal meaningful questions at networking. It'll help you stand out.
