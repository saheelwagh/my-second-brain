- ## part 1 : Where you are
  collapsed:: true
	- ### 1. What ux is and is not
		- #### who is a ux designer
		  collapsed:: true
			- **a UX designer is the personwho ensures that a product, service or anyother offering (digital or otherwise) offersa great experience to its user**
			- UX  is  more about    change    management    and organisational  adoption  of  user  centric methods than about actual design.
			- The sooner you realise that learning a new framework,  prototyping  tool,  or  UI  design technique  is  the  easiest  part  of  UX  skills development, the faster you’ll be able to shift focus  to  the  bigger  things  that  might  beholding you back. What you need to do is to be ready to get your hands dirty again and again until it becomes second nature to use some of these harder skills

		- #### ux in a nutshell
		  collapsed:: true
			- u need to  differentiate and communicate two things:
			  collapsed:: true
				- ux as a result and us as a process
					- ux as a process
						- double diamonf frameworek
						  collapsed:: true
							- every project u start at don't now an go to do know
							- noobs skip the crucial parts of identifying prolem and unpacking user challenges
							- the 2 diamods
							  collapsed:: true
								- design the right thingd
									- using ample quantitative insights, butmore importantly qualitative insights,gathered from user research todetermine what you need to design
								- design things  right
									-
							- phases and activites
							  collapsed:: true
								- discovery -> run stakeholder wokshops
								- definition -> synthesize the findings
								- dev
								- deliver
							- You'll  notice  that  these  diverging  andconverging  funnels  are  the  basis  for  thediamond  shapes  in  this  process.  This  is  anessential part of the model that captures theunique thinking of UX designers.
							- at a minimum -> use it as reference to describe your ux process
							-
							-
							-
		- No UX w/o user research
		  collapsed:: true
			- User research should be run in a continuouscumulative  fashion  where  the  project  teamgoes through discovery, design, and deliverycycles. This is because to UX things properly,you must understand each case in depth.
				-
				  1. frame
				  2. Define hypotheses
				  3. Plan the research
				  4. Conduct
				  5. Synthesize
				  6. share and action
				- factors to consider
					- goals
					- evidence
					- cost and timeframe
					- target audience
					- covering people's behaviours as well as attitudes
					- Your  research  will  always  focus  ondiscovering what the users say (user attitudes)and what the users do (behaviours), and thenexpressing  that  in  quantitative  measures(indirect insights: what, where, how many),and qualitative insights (direct insights: who,what, how and, most importantly, why).
