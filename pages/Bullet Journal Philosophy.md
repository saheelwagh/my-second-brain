	- ### Decluttering Your Mind
		- we have  50k-70k thoughts per day
		- Just like when organizing a closet, we need to take everything out before wecan decide what stays and what goes. Creating a mental inventory is a simpletechnique that will help you quickly take stock of what you’ve been jamminginto your mental closet. Chances are there are a lot of useless responsibilitieshogging valuable mental and emotional real estate up there.
		- The Test This Mental Inventory you just created provides a clearpicture of how you’re currently investing your time and energy.It’s a map of your choices. The next step is to figure out whichones are worth making.

		  1. Things u need to do (tasks)
		  2. Your xp (events)

	- A common question I get is how much space the Daily Log requires. Myanswer: as much space as that day needs, and that’s something you just can’tknow in advance. Some Daily Logs can span many pages, while others won’ttake up half a page. It’s nearly impossible to tell how your day may unfold.Though it can be helpful to set an intention for the day, like Today I will notcomplain , it’s important to remember not to set an expectation for your day,because that’s out of your control.
	- The Monthly log
	  collapsed:: true
		- Calendar Page On the Calendar page, list the dates of that monthdown the left edge of the page, followed by the first letter of thecorresponding day of the week (this page ). Remember to leavesome room in the left margin so you can add Signifiers later, ifneeded. Signifiers will allow you to quickly scan your Calendarpage to find anything particularly noteworthy.
