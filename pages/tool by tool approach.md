- 've first noticed this approach being used by Shopify. The team at Shopify are providing little tools such as a logo generator and release these tools free for anyone to use. This not just builds goodwill with people; it also allows Shopify to attract powerful backlinks to their projects. As developers we are in the perfect position to build such mini-tools. It boosts morale and drives attention at the same time.
- Spend some time evaluating where your project or product will deliver value to the end-user. Look at options to split off small, independent tools. Build these and launch them before launching the whole product. This allows you to practice launching and promoting your part-projects at the same time. With each backlink to your part-projects you will enhance your ranking in Google. An example for a maker following this approach is Kamban with FlatGA. He built FlatGA as phase one of a bigger project currently in development.
