- Each person has an Emotional Elephant side and a Rational rider side
- You've got to reach out to both
- 3 necessary steps of switch framework
	- Direct the rider
		- follow the bright spots
			- investigate what is working and clone it
				- real life examples :
					- [[Jerry Sternin Vietnam example]]
					- [[Solutions focused therapy]]
					- [[Morning Gratitude Journal]]
		- Script the critical moves
			- Don't just think in big picture, think in terms of specific behaviours.
				- As both, a coder and a writer I find these behaviours to be habit building actions practiced (almost) daily. Such as writing 1k words, solving a [[frontend mentor.io]] challenge
					- These behaviours form a reference scale around which you can set the difficulty and frequency of underlying skill practice
					- This forms the systems based approach to
				- examples
					- from the book
						- [[Brazil Rail Rules]]
						- [[1% Milk]]
		- Point to the destination
			- change is easier when you know **where** you are going and **why** it matters
				- Again, in both fields these are specific outcomes to be targeted within a timeframe
