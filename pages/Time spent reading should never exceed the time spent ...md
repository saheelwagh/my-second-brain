- If you want to be a writer, does reading help?Sure. Just like watching reruns of games helped Michael Jordanbecome a better basketball player.But watching reruns of games isn’t how Michael Jordanbecame Michael Jordan.Reading should be an addition to your writing practice,just like stretching is to physical exercise.
