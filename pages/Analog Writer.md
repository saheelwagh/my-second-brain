- To become a writer,they believe,you must wear a chapeau, smoke a corn cob pipe, stare out thewindow and wait for inspiration to strike. Better yet, you mustdetach yourself from the world, find a cabin in the woods (Godforbid it has Internet), and dedicate the next 10 years of yourlife to writing the next Great American Novel. And if you diedoing it, even better. You have lived, and suffered, the life of atrue “writer.”
