Work on your business not in it

## How to read
Reverse engineer conceptual frameworks
Reading is about absorption not speed

## Good design takes time

## You are your number one client
Income rarely exceeds personal dev - [[Jim Rohn]]

## Sell your by products
[[Kingsford Charcoal]] -> Edward G. Kingsford helped Henry Ford with food supply for his plant.
Pressed block of reconstituted char -> Charcoal

If you produce motion graphics for your clients, for example, think about the byproducts you could package and resell to others.

This can include things such as: project templates, color correction presets (such as Andrew Kramer’s Video Copilot), animation rigs, scripts (AEScripts), and digital assets (textures, patterns, brushes). You could turn your “waste”

into a secondary business.

## To be happy, align : think + say + do
stress comes for not saying what you think and not doing what you say


## Expectation != reality
Expectation skew reality
The more a customer expects, the less satified they will be
Thus
Underpromise and overdeliver (and never the converse)

## Yes to excellence in  X = No to in Y
1000 W buld -> illuminates a room
1000 W laser -> Cuts through laser  
 - [[One Page Marketing Plan ]] book by Allan Dib
Choose projects that allow you to laser focus.

## Action Beats Intent

## Action Beats Intent
People who take action learn from each failure
They adapt  and iterate 
Better to act on a poor idea than to never act on a great idea

Action -> biggest predictor of success -> Just point action oriented people in the right direction and they'll figure out a way

## Grow by subtracting
- work on one daily goal
- if your belifs and mindsets  are holding you back, discard all but the one you can implement today

## Take 100 % responsibility for everything in your life - [[ The Compound Effect ]] book by Darren Hardy

Ask yourself :
why not ? 	why not me ? why not today ?

# Breaking Inertia
Sir Isaac Newton’s First Law of Motion states that an object will remain at rest or move at a constant speed in a straight line unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force. In other words, a body in motion tends to stay in motion. The motion you feel can be an illusion of progress. Allow me to use an analogy: your life. The struggle to maintain the status quo, to stay above water, to overcome your past, and to simply exist become an endless loop. This grind is like the gravitational pull of the Earth. It’s a powerful force that will hold you down.

To have a significant breakthrough, you need to hit escape velocity and break orbit. You must travel at a speed fast enough to break free of the pull of everything that’s holding you back. The heavier the forces that pull you down, the more thrust it will take. The biggest hurdle you’ll face in overcoming inertia is getting started. Having a clear goal is a critical step in focusing your energy. The clearer the goal, the more lift you’ll have. What do you want? Why do you want it? How will this impact your life and the lives of others?

Commit to min 30 days

Effort without clear goals is waste of energy

## The only guarantee in life : You will never get what you never ask for

In the real world, if you are remotely qualified for a job posting, apply. Just go for it. Don’t worry if you don’t hit all the requirements that are listed.

If you think the company will benefit from your intelligence, talent, attitude, and work ethic, apply. The worst that can happen is they say “No.” Even if they do, “No” just means

“Next Opportunity.”


# Context Switching Is a Productivity Killer 
 Move toward a schedule that looks like this:
 - focused 
 - with fewer distractions 
 - less context switching. 
 Each day is dedicated to a particular goal: writing, reading, meeting, making content, spending time with family, and self care.
 
 1. Be patient. Improve your scheduling incrementally
 2. Creativity expands and contract's with time allocated. ( [[Paretto's time principle]])
	 1. Utilize unrealsitic deadlines
	 2. Pressure creates focus and eliminates distractions
3.  Eliminate mystery about next step through scheduling
4.  Scheduling removes the guilt out of non work activities as that is what you are scheduled to at those times.
5.   [[ S.M.A.R.T]] goals

## Communication
Walk in my shoes -> anticipate
Questions >. answers
avg of 5 ppl
dont hold on to hate

comm  isn't the message you send but the feedback you get
W/O explaination ppl form their own narrative

Manner your mind
Talk to strangers
Be interesting, be interested

## Creativity
Start empty

Blind spots

The best way to learn is to teach

### Finding your superpower
- Turn your hobbies, talents and interests into a long term sustainanble career
- It might take time to build up your processes and acquire the skills
- In the short term earn with what is most clear and fastest laid out path
- Keep experiminting with what interets you most in managable regular time chunks
- Over time expand these to fulfill your life's mission.

### Fail forward
Fail in a way that it's in the spirit of generosity.Find a space in which you can fail without 
annoying many people. If you fail too big you don't get to play anymore.
There are only two choices in life : to learn or to be right. Choosethe latter and you will spend your life alone. 
If I fail to learn from it, the failure becomes exciting.

## Stress as excitement
Spend 80 % of the time :
1. Understadnign the problem
2. Understanding customer's needs
3. Form ideas and collect new info
4. Let the brin synthesize and process
Spend the reamining time working.
