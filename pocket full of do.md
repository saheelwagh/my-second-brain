Success formula
  

The closest thing to nding a sure re formula for success  
is to study the traits of successful people.

 

They tend to be: focused and consistent, re ective (evaluate actions to repeat or avoid), grateful (grounds you in being thankful for what you have while acknowledging the contributions of others), positive and optimistic, lifelong learners (eternally curious about the world around them), disciplined (make necessary sacri ces, delayed grati cation), take 100% responsibility for everything in their lives, and set big long-term goals while acting on small short-term goals.


 

Successful people don’t let setbacks, failures, and pessimism de ne who they are. They run toward change and embrace ideas that scare them.



 

I’d rather work a lot harder on my own business than to have someone else tell me what to do. I’d rather make less money for the opportunity to take calculated risks.

For I desire what few people want: to make mistakes and suffer the consequences of my own decisions. Working on your business is what entrepreneurs do. Working in your business is what employees do.


 

How To Read

Some read just to complete a checklist. Some read so that they can complete an assignment or to boast to others that they read such-and-such book.

How you read will largely determine what you get from what you read. Read with the intention not to remember, but to understand. Read to teach. It will transform how much you retain and what you’re able to apply to your life. Even if you don’t teach, pretend that you do.

 

Highlight sections you want to remember. Make notes about ideas that are important to you, and why. How can you apply this? In what instances have you encountered this before?

Draw diagrams and illustrations of what you have learned, insights you’ve gained, and discoveries you’ve made.

Reverse engineer “conceptual frameworks.” Test them to see if they work. Reduce what you learn to its core components.

Reading is not about speed. It’s about absorption.


 

Design is not fast food. Creativity isn’t something that can be dropped in a deep fryer and be ready in ve minutes. Your thinking and creative process require time: to examine the design brief, consume and process new information, and nd connections between seemingly disconnected ideas. When

a client approaches you with an impossible deadline, remind them that good design takes time.

If they insist on rushing the process, smile and politely refer them to Fiverr.com, where they can nd an abundant supply of fast and cheap ideas.


## you are your biggest client
 

Work hard on your job, but work harder on your personal development. It’s the best use of your time, with the highest return on investment.

As speaker and entrepreneur Jim Rohn says, “Income rarely exceeds personal development.”


## sell your by products 
 

In making something, you will create many other things. All inventions are made from smaller components. Sell the byproducts of your creation.

Kingsford Charcoal is a classic American story of selling your byproducts. Edward G. Kingsford helped Henry Ford nd a wood supply for his auto plants. Henry Ford saw the waste produced by the sawmill plants and wondered if they could be put to better use. By pressing the blocks of reconstituted char, he created an innovative new product—the charcoal briquette. Today, Kingsford converts more than one million tons of wood waste into briquettes a year. If you produce motion graphics for your clients, for example, think about the byproducts you could package and resell to others.

This can include things such as: project templates, color correction presets (such as Andrew Kramer’s Video Copilot), animation rigs, scripts (AEScripts), and digital assets (textures, patterns, brushes). You could turn your “waste” into a secondary business.

## think say do
 

Happiness is when what you think, say, and do are in perfect alignment. Recall the last time you were stressed out about something. What caused this?


 

Did you choose not to say “no” when you were asked to do something you were uncomfortable with? Did you receive the wrong order at a restaurant, but eat it anyway? Were you curious about a client’s budget but thought it rude to ask?


**The stress you feel is caused by not saying what you think.**

 

If you’re unsure about what the budget or creative parameters are, don’t stay silent. Ask. Say: “Before wrapping up, I wanted to know how will you make the decision on who to work with? Will you decide based on budget, as in, lowest budget wins? Will creative, or something else, in uence the decision?  
The reason I ask is because I want to make sure we answer this as thoroughly as possible.” Or, try: “Based on our conversation and preliminary understanding of scope, this project will land in between $X and $Y. How does that sound to you? Are you comfortable moving forward with this?”

Avoid the stress. Say what you think. Then do what you say.

## Happiness
 

Here’s another example: Creatives often overpromise and underdeliver, a commitment they make to their own detriment. Have you ever been guilty of saying, “You’re going to love these amazing ideas that we came up with?” Or, “I’ll have it done by tomorrow”—only

to realize that the task is harder than you anticipated and miss the deadline? Both are setups for failure. Generally speaking, the more a customer expects, the less likely they are to be satisfied with what you produce.

## saying yes and no
 

Win Without Pitching author Blair Enns observes that our careers are de ned by two phases. The rest is when we say yes to almost everything. We do this out of necessity. We are in the learning and growing stage, so it’s natural  
to explore many things. This is what initially accounts for our success. The second period is when we learn to say  no to almost everything. This is when we have to make  
the difficult choice of committing to an area of focus. It’s only when we are repeatedly exposed to the same type of problems that we can spot patterns, gain valuable insights, and develop deep expertise.
 

In his book, The 1-Page Marketing Plan, Allan Dib describes it this way: A 1,000-watt lightbulb will illuminate a room, whereas a 1,000-watt laser will cut a hole through steel. Same energy. Different results. My clients often worry that they have to do everything to win new business because they “can’t afford” to lose a prospective client.

Having a clear understanding of what you gain and what you lose will help you to make better decisions about the types of clients and projects you take on.

## Action Beats Intent
Ideas paired with action and follow through are a potent combination. Ideas alone are worthless.

Execution is where ideas live and die, because it’s where fluffy, abstract thought meets cold, hard reality. It’s why many people are afraid to do something.

They’re so worried that the gap that exists between their vision and their ability to make it happen is so great that it shuts them down. So they wait for their skill gap to close. In the meanwhile, people who take action learn from each failure. They adapt, iterate, and repeat.

 
Action is the biggest predictor of success. I’ve noticed it’s a common trait in everyone that I’ve successfully coached. They have a bias toward taking action. They don’t need all the steps, pros and cons weighed, proof, or theories about why it’ll work. They just need to be pointed in a direction and they go! When I advised Ben Burns to re his clients because he was working too hard for too little, he didn’t hesitate. The very next day, he made 53 phone calls. He lost all but three of his clients. Of the three he kept, he was able to raise his fees such that he earned more than the previous 53 combined!

## live 365
Forget New Year’s resolutions—make New Day’s goals instead. Setting daily, instead of annual, goals is much more rewarding, attainable, and productive. It builds a positive habit and holds you accountable.

 

If you start to feel overwhelmed, I nd it helpful to write down the top three things I want to accomplish that day. Then I push everything else aside (email, social media, making calls, tidying up, or whatever).


 

As I accomplish each task, I happily check it off the list. It feels good to make progress and further motivates me to keep charging ahead.

It’s amazing what having a simple checklist will do to calm your anxiety and give you needed clarity and focus.

Small tasks are con dence boosters that set you up to win! Each time you crush a goal, you inevitably march toward your bigger, life-changing aims.

# when things don't add up, start subtracting
Try this exercise: Write down the beliefs you hold—as many as you can think of. These could be ideas about relationships, family, self-worth, business, personal and professional accomplishments, status, goals, work, behavior, etc. Write quickly. Write without judgment. The goal is to ll the page with your beliefs.

 

Start a second page and divide it into two columns. Label the left side “To Keep” and the right “To Discard.” Then, transfer each of your thoughts over and decide under which of the two columns to place it.

You may nd that you have unwittingly amassed a lot of beliefs that are detrimental to your growth. Do not get angry. Instead, thank each belief as being necessary for you to be where you are today. Happy decluttering!

 

In his book, [[Book : The Compound Effect]], Darren Hardy emphasizes that the single most important thing that he has to teach is to take 100% responsibility for everything in your life. Life isn’t fair. Now do something about it. 

Asking “why not?” is an expression of courage and willingness to act before knowing. Despite having limited information, we will act anyway. It might be good. It might be bad. But let’s go for it. It’s a dance with danger.


 

Logic, reason, and research will only take you so far. There will be gaps. Gaps in knowledge. Gaps in outcomes. Gaps in resources and talent.

Take a leap anyway. Roll the dice.  
Make a calculated risk. Step into the void.

Ask yourself, “Why not? Why not me? Why not today?”

## Break Inertia
To have a significant breakthrough, you need to hit escape velocity and break orbit. You must travel at a speed fast enough to break free of the pull of everything that’s holding you back.

 

The biggest hurdle you’ll face in overcoming inertia is getting started. Having a clear goal is  
a critical step in focusing your energy. The clearer the goal, the more lift you’ll have. What do you want? Why do you want it? How will this impact your life and the lives of others? If you do nothing, what are the consequences? When you are suf ciently red up, burst into action.

 

Your system needs to be shocked! Then, set small goals  
and reward yourself for each win. You are beginning to form new patterns and behaviors. Speed and momentum are your friends. Whatever you decide to do, commit to at least 30 days of doing it.

 

We are weighed down by our past, making our desired future challenging to attain. It’s the reason why meaningful change is so dif cult to achieve. It requires consistent effort over long periods. Though the gains you make are small and almost imperceptible, do not give up! One day, you’ll look up and realize you are no longer grounded, but in the heavens, gliding effortlessly among the celestial bodies.

## effort without clear goals is wasted energy
 

Travel fast, but travel in the right direction. Otherwise, it’s all wasted energy.

Failing and learning is super valuable—to you. Achieving a desired result quickly is super valuable—to the client.

 

If you want to be valuable to your client, try to determine what they perceive to be valuable and deliver it. Anything else is just wasting time, money, and energy—and a great way to run in circles.


## The one guarantee in life
 

Here are a few guarantees: You will never get what you don’t ask for. You can’t find what you aren’t looking for. “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”—Wayne Gretzky

 

“We want to have certainties and no doubts—results and no experiments—without even seeing that certainties can arise only through doubt and results only through experiment.” —Carl Jung

 

In the real world, if you are remotely quali ed for a job posting, apply. Just go for it. Don’t worry if you don’t hit all the requirements that are listed.

If you think the company will bene t from your intelligence, talent, attitude, and work ethic, apply. The worst that can happen is they say “No.” Even if they do, “No” just means

“Next Opportunity.”

## context switching is a productivity killer
Here is how I plan to live my life by living my plan. Move toward a schedule that looks like this: focused, with fewer distractions and less context switching. Each day is dedicated to a particular goal: writing, reading, meeting, making content, spending time with family, and self care.

One, it takes time getting used to, so be patient. You don’t have to be faithful to your calendar on day one. Ease into it.

Two, creativity expands and contracts to the time allotted. Surprisingly, you’ll get the same amount of work done even when you allow yourself less time to complete it.

Deadlines create pressure. Pressure creates focus and eliminates distractions.

Three, by scheduling each day, I remove the mystery of what I will be doing.

 

This is oddly therapeutic. I no longer have anxiety over the “What am I supposed to be doing today?” question. I already know because it’s on the calendar.

Four, I no longer feel guilty about doing non-related work activities like reading or writing. I remind myself, it’s OK; this is what I’m supposed to be doing. In one month alone, I was able to read more books than I had in the previous six months. How was this possible? I prioritized the activity and dedicated a day to enjoying the act of reading.


# Creativity
## start empty
  

Con rmation Bias—referencing only those perspectives that fuel our pre-existing views, while at the same time ignoring or dismissing ideas that threaten our worldview. We tend to lter out feedback that does not support our assumptions. One way to check your bias is to take the opposite side and make a case for it.

Groupthink and the Bandwagon Effect—we desire to maintain harmony and avoid con ict between members of the group by agreeing with decisions that may not align with the correct answer. One remedy is to avoid stating your preferences

or expectations. Assign one person to question/challenge assumptions as the default position.

Clustering Illusion and Reporting Bias—happens when we look for patterns in a pool of random data. The remedy is to increase the sample size and weigh evidence equally, not just the elements that con rm your beliefs and assumptions.

Assumptions. Preconceived ideas. Bias. These are all things that conspire against your ability to listen and to truly hear and see things for what they are—without judgement, attachment, or prejudice. When researching, be aware of the forms of cognitive bias and the ways they can in uence your thinking, the questions you ask, and how you interpret what you hear.
## blind spots
 

We just lack objectivity, which comes with time and distance. But is it possible to be objective while creating? Yes, through the deliberate practice of passionate detachment.

It’s a beautiful dance between being vulnerable, emotional, and intuitive while creating (passionate)—and then letting go, the instant you stop working (detachment).

The day after a big game, most professional athletes study videotape of their performance. They can watch from a distant and objective point of view, and identify where their strengths and weakness are.

Try recording your next conference call with a client and listen to it. Did you create space for everyone to feel heard? Did you jump to the wrong conclusion? Did you cut anyone off? What did you miss? What did you get right? How can you improve? Write what you learn down and apply it. Repeat this process continually, and your blind spots will narrow.
## teach
You’ll stop to think about the true meaning of what you just read. You might even pause to compose a thoughtful tweet. Whether you are reading a book, watching a video, attending a class, participating in a workshop, or listening to a podcast, set your intention to learn to teach.
## finding your superpower
“If you love it, you’ll teach yourself. If you don’t, others teach you.”—Yukitaka Yamaguchi. It comes from a short YouTube documentary by Eater. He goes on to explain, “If you truly love what you do, nothing will stop you from learning. You will acquire expertise by any means possible. Nothing will stop you from becoming a master at your craft. If you don’t love it, you’ll have to pay others to teach you.”
If you’re not sure if you are following the right career path, ask yourself: What do you love? What gives you pure joy? Think back to the time when you were 7 years old: What couldn’t you wait to do? What made your heart race faster? What do you do today that you lose track of time doing? Those are good indicators.
 

For many years, I combined my passion and talent in design, entrepreneurship, and making videos into a very lucrative career. But I always felt like it was a job—a way to make money. Meanwhile, I had been teaching, another great passion of mine.

Although it was good for my creative soul and ful lled my desire to give back, the pay was lousy, comparatively speaking. It wasn’t until I created The Futur (an online education platform) that I harnessed all of my interests into a singular expression and found my true calling. The overlap of my passions—entrepreneurship, design, and education—has translated a job into a powerful mission!

 

The challenge, then, is to turn your hobbies, interests, and talents into a long-term, sustainable career. The overlap among all those things is your latent superpower. Tap into this well of strength, and you’ll soar in ways that you’ve only dreamt possible.



## fail forward
  

As Errol Gerson, a teacher of entrepreneurship, leadership, and business management at Art Center College of Design would say, “There are only two intentions in life. One is to learn. The second is to be right. You can choose to be right, but you’ll be very lonely.”

In my conversation with proli c writer and “observer of things” Seth Godin, he remarked, “Whoever fails the most, wins. If you fail too big, you don’t get to play anymore.”

The key is to strategically fail at the right scale. He goes on to explain that you need to nd a space where you can fail enough before you become successful and to do it in a way that doesn’t annoy other people. Fail in a way that it’s in the spirit of generosity.
## procrastination
 

My brain operates a little differently. I’m constantly learning, gathering new information, and listening to the needs of my audience. I’m collecting and forming new ideas. I’ll spend 80% of my time in this phase. Then I let my “archival brain” process and synthesize. The remaining 10%–20% of the remaining time I use to actually work on the project.

From the outside, what I’m doing looks like an avoidance strategy—the delay of the inevitable. In fact, it’s just my creative process.

I’ve learned how to interpret the stress as excitement. I revel in it. The heat and pressure boil down the bad ideas and leaves a sweet, delicious nectar! To me, what others might call procrastination is the creative elixir of life.
