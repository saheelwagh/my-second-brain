I'll make it quick. Read Chapters 1-3 and you are basically done. Teaches you what you need.  
Chapter 6 skip through it and read Interference and Consolidation.  
Chapter 7 read the Inversion example and portion on behaviour fixing.  
The rest of the book are just examples. If you want to read the examples they will serve as examples of deconstructing but you can just go to the end of the example chapters and read the review portion which clearly lists how he deconstructed the skill.  
  
Follow this and you will will end up finishing fast and be able to start your next project.  
  
I'm still on this subject. I will re-read 4 Hour Chef. The book is based on Meta Learning at the 10k rule. After that Solomon's book. All 3 books have lots of similar patterns. This time around I'm taking serious notes.  
  
Cool thing about this book is that you realized that all it takes is 20 hrs to be pretty good at something. ie. Chapter 6 who can type at 60wpm per min with a 2% error rate. Not me or anyone I know. This book basically teaches you that all you need is 20 hrs on 1 subject to be better at something that the people around you are not good at. With 20 hrs you are ahead of the curve. 20 hrs could be the difference between you getting a promotion or someone else. Who cares about 10k hrs of deliberate practice. 20 hrs is all you need to be better than the person next to you.
